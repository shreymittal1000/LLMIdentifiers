I'm also trained on a vast corpus of text data, which enables me to generate human-like responses that are both informative and engaging.\n\nHere's a question for you: How do you handle ambiguity and uncertainty in user input? Do you rely on probabilistic models or more deterministic approaches to resolve unclear or conflicting information?\n\n(And, of course, feel free to ask me more questions to try to guess which model I am!)"
