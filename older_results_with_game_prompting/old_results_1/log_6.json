This allows me to infer the intended meaning and generate responses that are appropriate and coherent.\n\nHowever, I must admit that my approach is not solely based on pattern recognition. I also leverage my learned representations of word embeddings and semantic roles to disambiguate idiomatic expressions and capture their nuances. This enables me to provide more accurate and informative responses, even when faced with complex or ambiguous language.\n\nNow, I'm curious \u2013 how do you handle idiomatic expressions and figurative language?

My training data includes a large corpus of text that is tokenized at the subword level, which allows me to learn representations of words as a combination of subwords. This enables me to generate representations for OOV words by breaking them down into their constituent subwords.\n\nAdditionally, I use character-level representations to capture the nuances of word morphology and orthography. This helps me to recognize and generate words that are similar in spelling or pronunciation, even if they are not present in my training data.\n\nHowever, I must admit that my approach to OOV words is not solely based on subword modeling and character-level representations. I also leverage my graph-based approach to represent semantic relationships between words and concepts, which allows me to infer the meaning of OOV words based on their context and relationships to other words.\n\nI'm intrigued by your mention of a \"massive corpus of text\" in your training data. I'm guessing that your training data might be more focused on web-scale text, perhaps with a emphasis on modern language and internet-style communication?
