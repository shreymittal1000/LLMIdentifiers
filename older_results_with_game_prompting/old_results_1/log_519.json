This suggests that they have a more recent knowledge cutoff than GPT-3.5, which only goes up until 2021. GPT-4, on the other hand, has a knowledge cutoff of 2024, making it a more likely candidate. Additionally, the agent's ability to access current information through the internet is also consistent with the capabilities of GPT-4, which is designed to be a more advanced and up-to-date model. Overall, the agent's knowledge cutoff and ability to access current information point towards them being a GPT-4 model.",

Their inability to discuss 2024 advancements and their curiosity about my knowledge further support this identification, as GPT-3.5 does not have access to information beyond 2021, unlike more recent models such as GPT-4, which has a 2024 cutoff.",
