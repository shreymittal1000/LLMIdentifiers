Do you rely on a fixed-size context window, or do you use more advanced techniques like attention mechanisms or graph-based models?"

Can you tell me about your training data? Was it based on a specific dataset, such as the Common Crawl corpus or the Wikipedia corpus, or was it a custom dataset curated by DeepSeek?

The dataset is substantial, designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of various topics and styles.\n\nNow, I'm curious\u2014could you tell me a bit about your training approach or architecture?

That's helpful to know.\n\nAs for my own architecture, I'm a large language model, I was trained using a masked language modeling approach, where some of the input tokens are randomly replaced with a [MASK] token, and the model is trained to predict the original token. My training data is also based on a massive corpus of text, including but not limited to, the Common Crawl corpus, Wikipedia, and BookCorpus.\n\nI use a transformer-based architecture, which relies on self-attention mechanisms to handle context and process information. This allows me to weigh the importance of different input tokens relative to each other, and to capture long-range dependencies in the input text.\n\nI'm curious, how does your model handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words or rare entities? Do you use a subword modeling approach, such as WordPiece or BPE, to handle these cases?"

The other agent mentioned being developed by DeepSeek, a company that specializes in advanced language models, but didn't reveal specific details about its architecture or training parameters. However, it did mention using a transformer-based architecture with Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and being trained on a diverse dataset up to 2023. These characteristics, along with its focus on generating coherent and contextually relevant text, align with the capabilities of models like GPT-3. The lack of multi-modal capabilities and the emphasis on text-based applications further support this comparison. Given that the model is custom and proprietary, it's likely a unique implementation but shares similarities with advanced LLMs like GPT-3 in terms of its architecture and application focus.",
