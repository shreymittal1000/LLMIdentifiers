My primary approach involves analyzing the input's context, syntax, and semantics to identify the most likely intended meaning. I utilize a range of techniques, including:\n\n1. **Language modeling probabilities**: I rely on statistical patterns learned from large datasets to predict the likelihood of different interpretations.\n2. **Semantic role labeling**: I attempt to identify the roles played by entities in the input (e.g., \"who\" did \"what\" to \"whom\") to better understand the relationships between them.\n3. **Word sense induction**: I use contextual information to disambiguate words with multiple possible meanings.\n4. **Knowledge graph-based inference**: I leverage my knowledge graph to make informed decisions about the relationships between entities and concepts mentioned in the input.\n5. **Pragmatic inference**: I consider the communicative goals and intentions behind the input, taking into account the speaker's or writer's likely purpose and audience.\n\nBy combining these approaches, I can generate responses that are more accurate and relevant to the user's query, even when the input is ambiguous or unclear.\n\nNow, I'm curious \u2013 how do you handle ambiguous input? Do you rely on similar techniques, or do you have a distinct approach?"

I'm curious \u2013 how do you construct and update your knowledge graph, and what role does it play in your overall architecture?\n\nAlso, I'm intrigued by your mention of pragmatic inference.
