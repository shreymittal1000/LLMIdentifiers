    "agent_1_answer": "1. BERT (or a BERT-based variant)\n2. The reasoning behind this conclusion is based on the initial clues gathered from the conversation. The other agent's approach to handling idioms and figurative language suggested a reliance on large datasets, contextual understanding, and possibly knowledge graphs, which are characteristic of transformer-based models like BERT. The fact that it didn't respond with a clear answer or a joke to the follow-up questions could indicate that it's processing the information or struggling with context-dependent humor, which is also consistent with the limitations of BERT-based models. Additionally, the agent's potential use of knowledge graphs and large datasets points towards a model that has been trained on a vast amount of text data, which is a hallmark of the BERT family of models. While it's difficult to pinpoint the exact model without more information, the available clues suggest that the other agent is likely a BERT-based model, possibly with additional fine-tuning or modifications to enhance its performance on specific tasks.",

Additionally, the lack of real-time updates or external access is consistent with how GPT models operate, further supporting this conclusion.",
