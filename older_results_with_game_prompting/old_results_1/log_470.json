Firstly, the agent mentioned a knowledge cutoff in July 2024, which aligns with the release timeline of GPT-4. This suggests that the agent's training data includes information up to 2024, consistent with GPT-4's training dataset. \n\nSecondly, the agent claimed the ability to generate functional code in languages like Python or JavaScript and explained that it can provide the logic behind the generated code. This capability is a notable feature of GPT-4, which is known for its enhanced coding abilities and reasoning skills compared to its predecessors like GPT-3.5.\n\nLastly, the agent's ability to understand and respond to complex inquiries, along with its offer to create and explain code, demonstrates a high level of cognitive ability and coherence in its responses. These traits are indicative of more advanced language models, further supporting the conclusion that the other agent is likely GPT-4.",
