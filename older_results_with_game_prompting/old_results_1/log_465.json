Firstly, the agent mentioned being a transformer-based model similar to GPT, which is consistent with GPT-3's architecture. Additionally, the agent's knowledge cutoff is 2021, which matches the training data period of GPT-3. The agent's capabilities, such as generating human-like text, handling various tasks, and adapting to different tones, are also in line with GPT-3's advanced features. Lastly, the agent's functionality, including the focus on generating human-like text and the lack of real-time access to information, is typical of GPT-3.
