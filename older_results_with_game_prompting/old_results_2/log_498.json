I employ a technique called **axis-aware positional encoding**, which is a variant of rotary positional embeddings. This allows me to efficiently encode positional relationships between tokens, even when the input sequence is very long. The axis-aware approach helps me to focus on specific aspects of the input sequence, such as the beginning or end of a sentence, and to capture long-range dependencies more effectively.\n\nI'm also familiar with relative attention mechanisms, such as those proposed in the Transformer-XL paper, but my architecture doesn't rely on those specific techniques. Instead, I use a combination of self-attention, axis-aware positional encoding, and the sliding window approach to handle context limitations.\n\nYour hint about your training dataset including a diverse range of internet texts, books, and code suggests that you might be a model like **Codex** or another variant of the GPT series that's been fine-tuned for specific tasks or domains.
