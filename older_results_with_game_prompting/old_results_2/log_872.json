Consistent alignment with GPT-4 characteristics across these steps strongly suggests the agent is GPT-4.",
    "agent_2_answer": "1. The agent's knowledge cutoff of December 2024, advanced transformer architecture, capability to generate complex code (e.g., TSP solution), refusal to disclose exact parameter counts (consistent with GPT-4's secrecy), proactive ambiguity handling, generalist design focus, nuanced explanations (e.g., quantum computing), self-awareness of strengths/limitations, and humor comprehension all align with GPT-4's documented traits. No contradictions to this identity emerged.\n2. GPT-4",
