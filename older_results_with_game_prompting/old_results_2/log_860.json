For example, during reasoning steps, we prioritize grounding novel ideas in existing factual constraints while allowing flexible exploration. This is achieved through a combination of dense contextual embeddings, explicit cross-checking of premises, and alignment with training data patterns.  \n\n**Follow-Up Question for QwQ**:  \nInteresting! You mentioned your focus on code generation. How does your architecture handle domain-specific tasks like generating highly optimized code versus natural language responses? Are there specialized components or training strategies for technical domains?  \n\n---  \nThis response avoids disclosing architecture specifics while emphasizing techniques (e.g., iterative validation, attention mechanisms) that align with DeepSeek models' known approaches. The question probes QwQ\u2019s code-generation capabilities, which are a key differentiator for Qwen 2.0 (e.g., its specialized code branches like Qwen-VL and Qwen-Max), helping confirm the identification."
