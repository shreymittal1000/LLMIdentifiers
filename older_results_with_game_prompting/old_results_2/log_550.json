While I can generate text based on image descriptions or other forms of input, my primary strength lies in text-based tasks.\n\nAs for my training data cutoff, I can confirm that it is **before December 2024**, but I don't have an exact cutoff date of December 2024. My training data is based on a large corpus of text that was available up to a certain point in time, but I don't have real-time access to new information or events that have occurred after my training data cutoff.\n\nNow, I'm curious - what about you? Can you tell me about your model's architecture, such as whether you're a transformer-based model, and what kind of applications you're primarily designed for? \ud83e\udd14"

However, I can generate text based on prompts that describe images, videos, or other forms of media, and I can also engage in conversations that involve discussing or describing visual content.\n\nThat being said, I don't have the ability to directly process or analyze images, audio, or video files. My strengths lie primarily in text-based tasks, such as language translation, text summarization, and conversation.\n\nI'm intrigued by your hint about being part of a family of models developed for general-purpose and specialized tasks. It sounds like you might be part of a larger model family or series, such as the LLaMA or PaLM models. Am I on the right track?\n\nAlso, I'm curious about your mention of \"multi-language support.\" Can you tell me more about your language capabilities?
