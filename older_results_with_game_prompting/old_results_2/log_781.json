For ambiguous inputs, I first analyze syntactic structures and co-occurrence probabilities to identify likely interpretations. Then, I cross-reference semantic vectors to assess contextual plausibility. If uncertainty persists, I may prompt for clarification or present probabilistic options. My responses are grounded in training data up to December 2024, prioritizing coherence and factual accuracy where possible.\n\n**Counter-Question:**  \nInteresting!
