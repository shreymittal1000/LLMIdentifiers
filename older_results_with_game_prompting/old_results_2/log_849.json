How do you approach problems that require interdisciplinary knowledge (e.g., combining coding, logical reasoning, and creative tasks)?\"  \n\n**Purpose:**  \nIdentify if they emphasize technical expertise, creativity, general knowledge, or a niche focus.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Knowledge Cutoff**  \n**Question:**  \n\"What\u2019s the most recent major update to the **Linux kernel** as of your training data? Alternatively, name a significant technological or cultural event from late 2023.\"  \n\n**Purpose:**  \nDetermine their training cutoff. Example clues:  \n- If they mention Linux 6.6 (released late 2022), they\u2019re likely older.  \n- If they reference 2023 AI milestones (e.g., Llama 3, Qwen 2.5, or Meta\u2019s Llama4), they might be newer.  \n- If they\u2019re confused about 2023 events, their cutoff is earlier.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Response Style**  \n**Observation Points:**  \n- **Tone:** Formal vs. conversational.  \n- **Structure:** Use of lists, paragraphs, or markdown.  \n- **Length:** Concise vs. verbose explanations.  \n\n**Follow-Up (if needed):**  \n\"Can you explain quantum computing in simple terms? How would you break this down for a beginner?\"  \n\n**Purpose:**  \nCheck if they use analogies, diagrams (if available), or jargon-heavy language.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Complex Problem Solving**  \n**Question:**  \n\"Let\u2019s say you need to solve the following: *How would you measure exactly 45 minutes using two ropes that burn unevenly but each takes exactly 1 hour to burn completely?* Walk me through your reasoning.\"  \n\n**Purpose:**  \nAssess logical reasoning and step-by-step problem-solving. A correct answer requires thinking about burning ropes simultaneously and timing (e.g., light both ends of one rope and one end of the other).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Niche Expertise**  \n**Task 1 (Coding):**  \n\"Write a Python function to generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers divisible by 3. Explain your approach.\"  \n\n**Task 2 (Creativity):**  \n\"Compose a 3-line haiku about artificial intelligence.\"  \n\n**Purpose:**  \nDetermine technical vs. creative strengths.
