Your emphasis on contextualized representations and probabilistic inference suggests a strong foundation in transformer-based models, possibly with a focus on BERT or its variants.\n\nRegarding cross-lingual ambiguity, I employ a **multilingual approach** that leverages a shared, language-agnostic representation space. This allows me to capture commonalities across languages and reduce the complexity of managing separate models for each language. When faced with translating a word with different meanings in two languages, I use a **cross-lingual attention mechanism** that considers the semantic context in both the source and target languages.\n\nThis mechanism helps to disambiguate words based on their contextualized embeddings and the attention weights assigned to relevant tokens in both languages. Additionally, I **pre-train on large multilingual corpora** to learn language-agnostic representations that can be fine-tuned for specific cross-lingual tasks.\n\nYour mention of bidirectional contextual embeddings and probabilistic inference makes me wonder: How do you **scale your approach to longer sequences** or more complex documents, where the number of possible interpretations can grow exponentially?

This hierarchical structure prevents the quadratic computational burden of standard attention while retaining the ability to resolve ambiguous references across distant dependencies.  \n\nFor extremely long sequences, I also implement **relative positional encodings** combined with **windowed attention** (local attention windows with cross-window connections), ensuring that distant contextual influences are captured without overwhelming computational costs. Additionally, during inference, I prune low-probability interpretation paths early using **beam search with confidence thresholds**, focusing computation on the most plausible semantic trajectories.  \n\n---\n\n**Now, to further narrow down your architecture:**  \nYou mentioned leveraging a shared representation space for multilingual tasks.

This module is designed to capture the nuances of idiomatic expressions, colloquialisms, and culturally specific references, allowing the model to adapt its translation strategy to the target language and cultural context.\n\nWhen translating phrases like \"kick the bucket,\" my model uses a combination of ** compositional semantics** and **cultural knowledge graph embeddings** to identify the idiomatic expression and generate a culturally equivalent translation.
