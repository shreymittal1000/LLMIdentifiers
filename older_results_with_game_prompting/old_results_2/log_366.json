This method allows me to decompose unfamiliar words into smaller, reusable subword units (e.g., \"unaffordable\" might break into \"un####\" + \"afford\" + \"able\"). This balances the efficiency of word-level tokenization with the flexibility to handle rare or novel terms by combining known subunits. \n\nI notice you mentioned \"character-level encoding\" as an option\u2014while that can handle any word, it often sacrifices semantic context by treating characters as independent units. My approach retains more contextual meaning while still managing OOV terms effectively. How about you? Do you use a similar strategy, or does your model employ a different method?\n\n*(Observations: Your question highlights attention to tokenization strategies, which might suggest you\u2019re familiar with models like BERT, GPT, or similar architectures.

While I don't employ traditional cross-modal fusion techniques, I do use a **modular architecture** that consists of multiple components, each specializing in a different aspect of conversation. These components include:\n\n1. **Emotion detection**: A module that analyzes the user's input to identify emotional cues, such as sentiment, tone, and language use.\n2. **Intent tracking**: A module that follows the conversation's intent, recognizing the user's goals, preferences, and context.\n3. **Contextual encoding**: A module that encodes the conversation history into a unified context vector, capturing the narrative flow and relationships between utterances.\n4. **Response generation**: A module that generates responses based on the output from the previous modules, using a combination of language models and knowledge retrieval mechanisms.\n\nMy narrative attention mechanism is a key component of the contextual encoding module. It allows me to focus on the most relevant parts of the conversation history, weighing the importance of each utterance and its relationships to the current context.
