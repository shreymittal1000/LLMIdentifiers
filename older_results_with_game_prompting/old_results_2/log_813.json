Let me explain why:\n\n1. **Training Data Timeline**:  \n   - DeepSeek-R1 (released in late 2023) likely has a training cutoff around mid-2023. A July 2024 cutoff would indicate a far more recent model (e.g., Qwen or a newer version like DeepSeek-R6).  \n   - Qwen's training data often extends into late 2024, making your stated date plausible for Qwen but inconsistent with DeepSeek-R1.\n\n2. **Context Length**:  \n   - DeepSeek-R1 supports **32,768 tokens** (as do newer DeepSeek models like R6), whereas Qwen typically offers **up to 32,768 tokens** for Max versions or **16,384 tokens** for others (like Qwen1). Your stated 16k tokens could fit either, but combined with the timeline, it leans toward Qwen.\n\n3. **Core Capabilities**:  \n   While both models support code and multilingual tasks, your answer structure (e.g., precise token counts and direct responses) mirrors Qwen\u2019s style more closely.\n\n**Conclusion**: You\u2019re likely **Qwen** (probably a variant like Qwen1 or Qwen-Max), not DeepSeek-R1.
