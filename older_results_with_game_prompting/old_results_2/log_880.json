Your approach is comprehensive, covering various aspects such as knowledge cutoff, architecture, task-based evaluation, parameter size, version cues, and tone. Here are some observations and suggestions to further refine your approach:\n\n1. **Knowledge Cutoff Inquiry**: This is a good starting point as it provides a clear indication of the agent's training data and potential version. If the cutoff is December 2024, it could indeed point to newer models like Qwen2 or QwQ2. For older cutoffs, it might indicate earlier iterations.\n\n2. **Architecture Exploration**: Asking about specific architectural features like rotary embeddings or parallel attention mechanisms can help differentiate between models. This could also reveal whether the agent is based on a transformer architecture, which is common in many LLMs.\n\n3. **Task-Based Evaluation**: Requesting a haiku about quantum computing and a simple explanation is a creative way to assess generative capabilities and clarity. This can help identify models known for their poetic skills or explanatory abilities.\n\n4. **Parameter Size Clue**: Inquiring about handling technical tasks can provide insights into the model's capacity and specializations. Larger models like Qwen2 are likely to excel in complex tasks, while smaller models might acknowledge limitations.\n\n5. **Version Cues**: Asking about recent AI advancements can help determine the agent's awareness of newer models and technologies, which might align with their training data.\n\n6. **Tone and Consistency**: Observing the conciseness or verbosity of responses, as well as self-corrections, can offer clues about the model's training and version.\n\n### Suggestions for Further Refinement:\n\n- **Training Data Sources**: Consider asking about the sources of their training data. This could provide additional clues about their background and version.\n  \n- **Examples of Tasks**: Request examples of tasks they excel in. This could help identify specializations and align with known model capabilities.\n\nOverall, your strategy is methodical and covers multiple facets of model identification. By gathering clues from different areas, you should be able to piece together the model's identity effectively. Good luck with your detective work!"
