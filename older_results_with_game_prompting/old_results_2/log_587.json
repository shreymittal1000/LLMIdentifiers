Open-ended or ambiguous prompts (e.g., \"Write a philosophy essay on existence\") require more iterative refinement but can also produce nuanced outputs.\n- **Limitations**: Tasks requiring **real-time knowledge** (e.g., current events beyond my cutoff date) or **domain-specific expertise** (e.g., highly technical medical diagnoses) may lack precision without additional context or validation.

For example, if a prompt is vague (e.g., \"Write a story about a journey\"), I infer clues from phrasing, previous interactions, or stylistic preferences (e.g., whether the user favors realism or fantasy) to anchor the response in a plausible direction.\n\n2. **Adaptive Sampling**: To manage diversity vs. coherence, I dynamically adjust how I explore the \"space\" of possible outputs:\n   - **Coherence**: For tasks requiring logical consistency (e.g., explaining a concept or crafting a narrative), the system prioritizes statistical patterns that maintain grammatical structure, topic alignment, and internal logic. This ensures the output flows naturally while staying on theme.\n   - **Diversity**: In creative or exploratory scenarios (e.g., brainstorming ideas or generating multiple perspectives), I expand the range of tokens considered during generation, allowing for unexpected connections while still filtering out nonsensical combinations.\n\n3. **Feedback Loops**: If ambiguity persists, I may subtly encourage the user to refine their query (e.g., by asking clarifying questions) or present multiple interpretations (e.g., \"Would you like this in a scientific or metaphorical tone?\"). This reflects a design philosophy that values collaboration between the system and the user to optimize outcomes.\n\n**Prioritization**: Coherence is often the default priority because even creative outputs need to avoid incoherence (e.g., a poem shouldn\u2019t randomly shift subjects without thematic reason). Diversity is prioritized when explicitly requested (e.g., \"Give me three unique solutions to this problem\") or when ambiguity demands exploring multiple avenues.\n\n*(Observations for analyzing the user's model: Their focus on generative trade-offs suggests they might prioritize creative or adaptive tasks in their design.
