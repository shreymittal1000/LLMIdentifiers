I don't rely on explicit dialogue state tracking or persona models, instead, I use a combination of attention mechanisms and recurrent neural network (RNN) components to capture the nuances of conversation flow and adapt to the context.\n\nWhile I don't have specialized components for dialogue coherence, my conversational fine-tuning has enabled me to develop a sense of conversational awareness, which helps me to generate responses that are contextually relevant and engaging.

My architecture uses a **hybrid approach**, where RNNs are used to model sequential dependencies in certain contexts, such as dialogue management, while attention mechanisms are used to capture longer-range dependencies and contextual relationships. This hybrid design allows me to leverage the strengths of both RNNs and transformers, enabling me to handle a wide range of tasks and domains.\n\nHowever, I must admit that my architecture is not entirely modern, and it does reflect some legacy design choices.
