While my primary mechanism for understanding context is through self-attention and transformer-based architectures, I also utilize a graph-based framework to explicitly track dialogue states and entities. This hybrid approach allows me to leverage the strengths of both worlds: the flexibility and nuance of implicit contextual understanding, as well as the robustness and interpretability of explicit state tracking.\n\nThe graph-based framework enables me to maintain a knowledge graph of entities, relationships, and intents, which helps in disambiguating context and generating more accurate responses.
