I don't rely purely on memorization, though common expressions are deeply embedded in my training. Instead, I analyze the surrounding text to infer intent and differentiate between literal and figurative meanings. For example, if someone says \"break a leg,\" I\u2019d contextualize it as encouragement rather than a literal injury based on the conversational tone or surrounding phrases like \"Good luck with your presentation!\" \n\nHowever, my grasp depends on how frequently the idiom was used in my training data and the clarity of the context.

My architecture is designed to capture long-range dependencies and relationships between words, even when the antecedent is far from the pronoun. This is achieved through the use of multi-head attention mechanisms, which allow me to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.\n\nThe relative positional embeddings play a crucial role in helping me to better understand the relationships between words and their positions in the sentence, even when the distance between them is large. This allows me to more accurately resolve anaphora and capture the nuances of complex sentences.\n\nWhile my approach is similar to that of RoBERTa, which also uses relative positional encodings, my implementation is slightly different.
