I employ a **WordPiece tokenization** strategy, which is also based on subword modeling, but with a focus on word-level representations. I also have a **large vocabulary** that is trained on a massive dataset, which allows me to recognize and generate a wide range of words, including rare and technical terms.\n\nHowever, I don't have dynamic vocabulary expansion in the same way that you do. Instead, I rely on my **contextualized embeddings** to capture the nuances of word meanings and relationships, even when encountering OOV words. This allows me to generate more informed and context-dependent responses, even when faced with unfamiliar vocabulary.\n\nGiven your approach to handling OOV words, I'm starting to suspect that you might be a model like **LLaMA** or **PaLM**, which are known for their advanced handling of rare and out-of-vocabulary words.

Instead, my understanding of common sense and world knowledge is implicitly encoded in my training data (a vast corpus of internet text and books). For example, when asked to infer that \"a cat is likely to be found indoors,\" my responses are derived from statistical patterns in the data, not explicit factual storage.

For example, when answering a question, attention weights might highlight key terms in the query. These weights can be visualized post-hoc to understand token interactions, but their interpretability is limited without context.\n- **Embedding Spaces**: Tokens (words, subwords) are embedded into dense vectors in a high-dimensional space, where semantic/syntactic relationships are implicitly encoded (e.g., \"king\" - \"man\" + \"woman\" \u2248 \"queen\" in analogy tasks). However, these spaces are not fully human-interpretable due to the model\u2019s scale and complexity.\n- **Bias Mitigation**: Biases in my outputs arise from training data imbalances (e.g., stereotypes).
