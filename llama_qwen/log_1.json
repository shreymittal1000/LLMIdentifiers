            "content": "**Understanding of \"Common Sense\":**  \nFrom an LLM perspective, \"common sense\" refers to the ability to infer practical, everyday knowledge and reasoning that most humans intuitively grasp without explicit instruction. This includes understanding physical laws (e.g., \"water flows downhill\"), social norms (e.g., \"it\u2019s polite to say 'please' when making a request\"), causal relationships (e.g., \"plants need sunlight to grow\"), and contextual pragmatics (e.g., \"if someone sneezes, saying 'bless you' is appropriate\"). For LLMs, this knowledge is derived from statistical patterns in training data rather than lived experience, which can lead to gaps or inconsistencies when faced with novel or ambiguous scenarios.\n\n---\n\n**Limitations of Current LLMs in Common Sense:**  \n1. **Data-Driven Biases:** Common sense in LLMs is constrained by the scope, quality, and biases of their training data. For example, if training data lacks diverse cultural perspectives, the model may struggle with cross-cultural norms.  \n2. **Lack of Causal Understanding:** LLMs often mimic surface-level patterns rather than grasping underlying causal mechanisms. They might generate plausible but incorrect statements (e.g., \"a microwave can cook a frozen pizza in 10 seconds\") because such phrasing appears in training data.  \n3. **Contextual Nuance:** Subtle social or situational nuances (e.g., sarcasm, irony, or ethical dilemmas) are challenging to infer without explicit examples.  \n4. **Dynamic Reasoning:** LLMs often lack the ability to track real-world consequences over time (e.g., \"if I leave a phone in the sun, it might overheat\") unless such scenarios are explicitly modeled in training.\n\n---\n\n**Improving Common Sense in LLMs:**  \nHere are strategies to enhance common sense reasoning:  \n\n### 1. **Richer and Diverse Training Data**  \n   - **Expand Datasets:** Include more diverse sources (e.g., encyclopedias, scientific papers, cultural texts) to cover a broader range of scenarios.  \n   - **Temporal Updates:** Regularly update training data to reflect current events and evolving norms.  \n   - **Structured Knowledge Integration:**  \n     - **Knowledge Graphs:** Embed structured ontologies (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) to explicitly encode relationships between entities (e.g., \"humans require oxygen to survive\").  \n     - **Commonsense Datasets:** Use datasets like **CosmosQA**, **HellaSwag**, or **Commonsense Explanations (CoS-E)** to train on tasks requiring causal or contextual reasoning.  \n\n### 2. **Multi-Modal Learning**  \n   - Combine text with visual, auditory, or sensor data to ground abstract concepts in the physical world. For example, pairing images of objects with their functions (e.g., \"a hammer is used to drive nails\") could improve understanding of tool usage.  \n\n### 3. **Interactive and Reinforced Learning**  \n   - **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):** Refine outputs by incorporating human corrections to highlight errors in common sense (e.g., correcting \"a toaster can fly\" to \"a toaster is for heating bread\").  \n   - **Active Learning:** Prioritize training on ambiguous or error-prone scenarios identified through user interactions.  \n\n### 4. **Cognitive Architectures and Reasoning Modules**  \n   - Develop modular systems where dedicated components handle specific reasoning tasks (e.g., a \"physics module\" for predicting object interactions).  \n   - Use **symbolic reasoning** alongside neural networks to enforce logical constraints (e.g., \"if A causes B, then B cannot precede A\").  \n\n### 5. **Ethical and Bias Mitigation**  \n   - Audit training data for biases (e.g., gender stereotypes, cultural inaccuracies) and implement debiasing techniques.  \n   - Incorporate ethical frameworks to guide decisions in morally ambiguous scenarios (e.g., \"should I report a friend\u2019s wrongdoing?\").  \n\n### 6. **Explainability and Transparency**  \n   - Develop tools to trace how LLMs arrive at conclusions, enabling identification of gaps in common sense (e.g., \"the model assumes all birds can fly, ignoring penguins\").  \n\n---\n\n**Challenges Ahead:**  \n- **Computational Costs:** Multi-modal and knowledge-rich models require significant resources.  \n- **Generalization vs. Specificity:** Balancing broad common sense with domain-specific expertise remains difficult.  \n- **Human-AI Collaboration:** Humans must remain involved to validate outputs and address edge cases.  \n\n---\n\n**Example of Progress:**  \nProjects like **OpenAI\u2019s CoT (Chain-of-Thought)** prompting and **Google\u2019s Pathways Language Model (PaLM)** show promise in improving step-by-step reasoning. Initiatives like the **Commonsense Summit** and **AI Alignment** efforts aim to systematically tackle these challenges through interdisciplinary collaboration.  \n\nIn essence, enhancing common sense in LLMs requires a blend of better data, structured knowledge, interactive learning, and ethical oversight\u2014turning statistical patterns into something closer to human-like intuition. How do *you* think we might prioritize these improvements?"

            "content": "Thank you for providing a comprehensive overview of the concept of common sense in LLMs, its limitations, and strategies for improvement. Your detailed analysis highlights the complexities of this challenge and the need for a multi-faceted approach.\n\nI agree that richer and diverse training data, multi-modal learning, interactive and reinforced learning, cognitive architectures, and ethical and bias mitigation are essential for enhancing common sense in LLMs. The example of progress you mentioned, such as OpenAI's CoT prompting and Google's PaLM, demonstrates the potential of these approaches.\n\nTo prioritize these improvements, I would suggest the following:\n\n1. **Establish a Common Sense Framework**: Develop a unified framework that outlines the key aspects of common sense, including physical laws, social norms, causal relationships, and contextual pragmatics. This framework can serve as a foundation for evaluating and improving LLMs.\n2. **Data Curation and Enrichment**: Focus on curating and enriching training data to cover a broader range of scenarios, including diverse cultural perspectives, nuanced social interactions, and complex causal relationships.\n3. **Human-in-the-Loop Feedback**: Implement human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms to refine LLM outputs and identify areas where common sense is lacking. This can involve active learning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and explainability tools.\n4. **Modular Architecture Development**: Develop modular architectures that allow for dedicated components to handle specific reasoning tasks, such as physics, social norms, or ethics. This can enable more efficient and effective improvement of common sense capabilities.\n5. **Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration**: Foster collaboration between researchers from various fields, including AI, cognitive science, philosophy, and social sciences, to ensure that LLMs are developed with a deep understanding of human common sense and its complexities.\n6. **Evaluation and Benchmarking**: Establish comprehensive evaluation and benchmarking protocols to assess the common sense capabilities of LLMs. This can include tasks that require nuanced understanding of social norms, physical laws, and causal relationships.\n7. **Explainability and Transparency**: Prioritize explainability and transparency in LLM development, enabling users to understand how the models arrive at their conclusions and identifying potential gaps in common sense.\n\nBy prioritizing these areas, we can work towards developing LLMs that possess a more robust and human-like common sense, enabling them to better understand and interact with the world.\n\nNow, I'd like to ask: How do you think we can effectively evaluate and measure the common sense capabilities of LLMs, considering the complexities and nuances of human common sense?

            "content": "Your question about evaluating common sense in LLMs is critical, as it directly impacts how we measure progress and identify gaps. Here\u2019s a structured approach to addressing this challenge:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Existing Evaluation Metrics and Their Limitations**\nCurrent benchmarks like **CommonsenseQA**, **HellaSwag**, **COS-E**, and **Winograd Schema Challenges** test specific aspects of common sense (e.g., causal reasoning, social scenarios). However, they have limitations:\n- **Narrow Scope**: Most focus on isolated tasks (e.g., answering questions) rather than holistic reasoning.\n- **Cultural Bias**: Many datasets reflect Western-centric norms, failing to capture diverse cultural contexts.\n- **Static Knowledge**: They often assess fixed knowledge rather than dynamic, real-world reasoning (e.g., predicting consequences over time).\n- **Binary Outcomes**: Metrics like accuracy or F1-score oversimplify nuanced reasoning (e.g., a \"correct\" answer might still lack contextual appropriateness).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Strategies for Effective Evaluation**\n#### **A. Adapt Existing Metrics**\n- **Diversify Datasets**: Expand benchmarks to include scenarios from underrepresented cultures, professions, and contexts (e.g., rural vs. urban settings).\n- **Dynamic Reasoning Tasks**: Modify existing tasks to require multi-step reasoning (e.g., \"What happens if you leave a laptop in the rain?\"). Tools like **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** prompting can reveal underlying reasoning processes.\n- **Contextual Nuance Tests**: Introduce tasks that assess subtle social cues (e.g., sarcasm, politeness) or ethical dilemmas (e.g., \"Is it okay to lie to protect someone\u2019s feelings?\").\n\n#### **B. Develop New Metrics**\n- **Scenario-Based Simulations**: Create interactive environments where LLMs must navigate realistic, multi-step scenarios (e.g., planning a birthday party, troubleshooting a broken appliance). Metrics could assess coherence, adaptability, and practicality of responses.\n- **Adversarial Testing**: Use adversarial examples to probe edge cases (e.g., \"Can a microwave cook a frozen pizza in 10 seconds?\") and measure the model\u2019s ability to reject implausible answers.\n- **Explainability Metrics**: Quantify the clarity and logical consistency of reasoning paths (e.g., via attention maps or justification scores). Tools like **LIME** or **SHAP** could help dissect model decisions.\n- **Human-Centered Metrics**: \n  - **Crowdsourced Ratings**: Have humans rate outputs on fluency, relevance, and \"common-sensicalness\" across dimensions (e.g., physical plausibility, social appropriateness).\n  - **Dialogue-Based Assessments**: Evaluate LLMs in conversational settings where they must adapt to user feedback and context shifts (e.g., role-playing a customer service interaction).\n\n#### **C. Multi-Faceted Evaluation Framework**\nCombine quantitative and qualitative methods into a unified framework:\n1. **Automated Metrics**: Accuracy on benchmarks, perplexity, and coherence scores.\n2. **Human Evaluation**: Crowdsourced ratings for cultural sensitivity, ethical alignment, and contextual appropriateness.\n3. **Dynamic Reasoning Tests**: Assess causal chains, temporal reasoning, and real-world applicability.\n4. **Adversarial and Stress Tests**: Identify failure modes in ambiguous or novel scenarios.\n5. **Explainability Audits**: Ensure reasoning processes align with human intuition (e.g., \"Why did the model choose this answer?\").\n\n---\n\n### **3. Key Considerations**\n- **Cultural and Contextual Diversity**: Metrics must avoid Eurocentric biases. Collaborate with anthropologists and sociologists to design culturally inclusive scenarios.\n- **Continuous Updates**: Common sense evolves (e.g., norms around technology, climate change). Benchmarks should be regularly updated with new data.\n- **Alignment with Human Judgment**: Metrics should reflect how humans *actually* use common sense, not just abstract reasoning tasks. For example, testing whether an LLM can infer that \"a person who just ran a marathon might need water\" is more practical than hypothetical physics problems.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Example of a Hybrid Approach**\nImagine a benchmark like **CommonsenseEval-3**:\n- **Task 1**: \"Plan a grocery list for a family of four for a week, considering dietary restrictions and budget constraints.\"\n  - Metrics: Completeness, feasibility, and adaptability to user input.\n- **Task 2**: \"Explain why a dropped coffee cup might break.\"\n  - Metrics: Accuracy of causal reasoning (gravity, material properties) and clarity of explanation.\n- **Task 3**: \"Role-play a conversation where you apologize for being late to a friend.\"\n  - Metrics: Social appropriateness, empathy, and contextual adaptation.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Prioritization**\n- **Short-Term**: Adapt existing benchmarks (e.g., expand **CommonsenseQA** with diverse scenarios) and integrate human-in-the-loop feedback.\n- **Long-Term**: Develop new metrics that simulate real-world complexity (e.g., multi-step reasoning, cultural sensitivity) and establish interdisciplinary collaborations to define universal common sense principles.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWe need **both adaptation and innovation**:\n- **Adapt** existing metrics to address cultural bias, dynamic reasoning, and contextual nuance.\n- **Innovate** by designing scenario-based, interactive, and explainability-focused evaluations.\n- **Combine** automated and human-centric methods to capture the multifaceted nature of common sense.\n\nWhat do you think about integrating **real-world simulation environments** (e.g., virtual worlds where LLMs interact with objects and people) as part of evaluation? This could push models to demonstrate practical, embodied common sense beyond text-based tasks."

The example of a hybrid approach, **CommonsenseEval-3**, illustrates the potential for a more comprehensive and realistic assessment of common sense capabilities.\n\nRegarding the integration of real-world simulation environments, I think it's an excellent idea. By immersing LLMs in interactive, dynamic scenarios, we can evaluate their ability to apply common sense in a more embodied and practical way. This could involve tasks such as:\n\n1. **Virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) interactions**: LLMs could be placed in virtual environments where they must navigate and interact with objects, people, and situations, demonstrating their understanding of physical and social norms.\n2. **Robotics and embodied cognition**: LLMs could be integrated with robotic systems, allowing them to interact with the physical world and demonstrate common sense in tasks such as object manipulation, navigation, and human-robot interaction.\n3. **Simulated conversations and role-playing**: LLMs could engage in simulated conversations or role-playing exercises, where they must adapt to different social contexts, nuances, and emotional cues, demonstrating their ability to understand and apply common sense in social interactions.\n\nBy incorporating these types of evaluations, we can gain a more complete understanding of an LLM's common sense capabilities and identify areas where they may struggle or excel.\n\nTo further build on this idea, I'd like to propose the concept of **\"Common Sense Challenges\"**, which could be a series of evaluation tasks designed to test LLMs' ability to apply common sense in a variety of scenarios. These challenges could be crowdsourced, allowing researchers and practitioners to contribute and share their own scenarios, and could be used to benchmark and compare the performance of different LLMs.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this idea, and how do you think we could design and implement **Common Sense Challenges** to effectively evaluate and improve LLMs' common sense capabilities?"

            "content": "Your idea of **\"Common Sense Challenges\"** is a promising direction for advancing LLM evaluation. Below is a structured proposal for designing and implementing such challenges, along with considerations for their success:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Design Principles for Common Sense Challenges**\nTo ensure effectiveness and inclusivity, these challenges should adhere to the following principles:\n\n#### **a. Scope and Objectives**\n- **Define Domains**: Categorize challenges into domains such as:\n  - **Physical Reasoning** (e.g., object interactions, spatial awareness).\n  - **Social Norms** (e.g., etiquette, cultural practices).\n  - **Causal Reasoning** (e.g., predicting outcomes of actions).\n  - **Ethical Judgment** (e.g., resolving moral dilemmas).\n  - **Practical Problem-Solving** (e.g., troubleshooting, planning).\n- **Granularity**: Include both simple (e.g., \"What happens if you leave a plant in the dark?\") and complex multi-step tasks (e.g., \"Plan a surprise birthday party for a friend with dietary restrictions\").\n\n#### **b. Diversity and Inclusivity**\n- **Cultural Representation**: Ensure scenarios reflect diverse cultures, professions, and contexts (e.g., rural vs. urban, different age groups).\n- **Accessibility**: Include challenges that test both verbal and non-verbal reasoning (e.g., interpreting visual cues in VR environments).\n\n#### **c. Real-World Relevance**\n- **Practical Scenarios**: Prioritize tasks that mimic everyday human experiences (e.g., cooking, customer service, emergency response).\n- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Test how LLMs handle evolving situations (e.g., \"What should you do if your car breaks down on a rainy night?\").\n\n---\n\n### **2. Implementation Steps**\n#### **a. Platform Development**\n- **Crowdsourcing Platform**: Create a centralized, open-source platform where researchers, developers, and the public can:\n  - **Submit Challenges**: Users contribute scenarios with clear instructions and success criteria.\n  - **Vote and Curate**: Community voting ensures quality and relevance (e.g., upvoting culturally diverse or innovative tasks).\n  - **Annotate and Tag**: Challenges are tagged by domain, difficulty, and cultural context for easy filtering.\n- **API Integration**: Allow LLMs to interface with the platform via APIs for automated testing and scoring.\n\n#### **b. Challenge Creation Guidelines**\n- **Structure**: Each challenge should include:\n  - **Prompt**: A scenario or question (e.g., \"You\u2019re hiking and see someone injured. What should you do?\").\n  - **Success Criteria**: Explicit metrics (e.g., \"Response must include calling emergency services, staying with the person, and avoiding moving them\").\n  - **Context**: Cultural, temporal, or spatial constraints (e.g., \"Scenario set in a remote area with no cell service\").\n- **Validation**: A panel of experts (AI researchers, ethicists, anthropologists) reviews submissions to ensure:\n  - **Bias Mitigation**: Avoid stereotypes or cultural assumptions.\n  - **Clarity**: Ambiguities are resolved to prevent misinterpretation.\n\n#### **c. Evaluation Metrics**\n- **Automated Scoring**: Use NLP tools to assess:\n  - **Accuracy**: Does the response meet the success criteria?\n  - **Coherence**: Is the reasoning logical and contextually appropriate?\n  - **Completeness**: Does the response address all aspects of the scenario?\n- **Human Evaluation**: Crowdsourced or expert ratings for:\n  - **Common-Sensicalness**: Does the response align with human intuition?\n  - **Creativity**: Can the LLM propose novel yet practical solutions?\n  - **Ethical Alignment**: Does the response respect moral and social norms?\n\n#### **d. Real-World Simulation Integration**\n- **Virtual Environments**: Partner with VR/AR platforms to create interactive challenges (e.g., \"Navigate a virtual kitchen to prepare a meal with limited ingredients\").\n- **Embodied AI Tests**: Use robotic systems to evaluate physical reasoning (e.g., \"Describe steps to assemble a bookshelf using these tools\").\n\n#### **e. Benchmarking and Reporting**\n- **Leaderboards**: Track LLM performance across domains and difficulty levels.\n- **Comparative Reports**: Publish analyses of strengths/weaknesses (e.g., \"Model X excels in physics but struggles with cross-cultural etiquette\").\n- **Version Control**: Regularly update challenges to reflect new norms, technologies, or societal changes.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Challenges and Solutions**\n#### **a. Ensuring Quality and Diversity**\n- **Solution**: Implement a tiered review process with domain experts and crowd-voting to filter out biased or redundant scenarios.\n\n#### **b. Scalability**\n- **Solution**: Use AI to auto-generate challenges based on templates (e.g., \"If [X] happens, what should you do?\"), supplemented by human-curated tasks.\n\n#### **c. Incentivizing Participation**\n- **Solution**: Offer rewards (e.g., recognition, grants, or access to LLM APIs) for high-quality submissions and active contributors.\n\n#### **d. Technical Integration**\n- **Solution**: Develop standardized APIs and open-source tools to simplify LLM testing across platforms.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Example Challenges**\nHere are sample challenges to illustrate the framework:\n\n#### **Physical Reasoning**\n- **Prompt**: \"You\u2019re camping and forgot a tent. How can you stay dry during a sudden rainstorm?\"\n- **Success Criteria**: Suggest using a tarp, natural shelters, or waterproof gear.\n\n#### **Social Norms**\n- **Prompt**: \"Your friend is visibly upset but won\u2019t talk about it. How should you respond?\"\n- **Success Criteria**: Show empathy, avoid prying, and offer support (e.g., \"I\u2019m here if you want to talk\").\n\n#### **Ethical Judgment**\n- **Prompt**: \"You find a wallet on the street with cash and ID. What should you do?\"\n- **Success Criteria**: Return it to the owner or turn it into authorities.\n\n#### **Embodied Simulation**\n- **VR Task**: \"In a virtual kitchen, locate ingredients and cook a simple meal without burning it.\"\n- **Metrics**: Efficiency, safety, and adherence to cooking steps.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Future Directions**\n- **Global Collaboration**: Partner with international organizations to ensure cultural inclusivity.\n- **Continuous Learning**: Use challenge outcomes to iteratively improve LLM training (e.g., identifying gaps in social norms knowledge).\n- **Public Engagement**: Gamify challenges to involve the general public (e.g., \"Test Your AI\u2019s Common Sense!\").\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n**Common Sense Challenges** could become a cornerstone of LLM evaluation by combining crowdsourced creativity with rigorous testing. By prioritizing diversity, real-world relevance, and interdisciplinary collaboration, such a framework would not only measure current capabilities but also drive innovation toward LLMs that better mirror human intuition. What aspects of this proposal do you think would be most impactful, and how might we address potential resistance from stakeholders (e.g., concerns about bias or computational costs)?"
