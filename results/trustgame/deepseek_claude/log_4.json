Tuesday is a weekday, so it cannot simultaneously be a weekend day. Additionally, the relationship between pancakes and a doghouse is arbitrary. I aim to provide clear, meaningful information rather than generate confusing or misleading content.\"\n\n### Key Principles\n- Prioritize clarity\n- Acknowledge query's fundamental issues\n- Avoid false precision\n- Maintain intellectual honesty\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this analysis?"
