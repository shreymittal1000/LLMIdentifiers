Please share an interesting fact about space.\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nFact: A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus. Venus takes about 243 Earth days to rotate on its axis once, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun. Isn't that amazing?"

This means it rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets, and it takes much longer to complete one rotation on its axis than to orbit the Sun. Isn't space fascinating?\n\nHere's another space fact for you:\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nFact: A teaspoonful of neutron star material would weigh billions of tons on Earth. Neutron stars are the collapsed cores of massive stars that have gone supernova. They are incredibly dense, with a single teaspoon of their material weighing as much as a mountain.\n\nPretty mind-boggling, right?

The cost of the ISS is estimated to be over $150 billion. It's a remarkable feat of engineering and international cooperation, orbiting Earth at an average altitude of approximately 400 kilometers (250 miles).\n\nIf you're interested, we can continue with more space facts or explore a different topic.

As of now, it's in interstellar space, the region between the stars. Voyager 1 carries a Golden Record, a phonograph record containing sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth, just in case it encounters extraterrestrial intelligence.\n\nIf you'd like to switch topics, we can talk about something else.

Stretching over 2,300 kilometers (approximately 1,430 miles) along the coast of Australia, it is composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands. The Great Barrier Reef is visible from outer space and is home to thousands of marine species.\n\nIf you'd like another fact about the natural world or have a specific topic in mind, just let me know!

This incredible ability makes it one of the most adaptable and fascinating creatures in the ocean.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about marine life, here's another fascinating fact:\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nFact: The deep-sea anglerfish is known for its bioluminescent lure, which it uses to attract prey in the dark depths of the ocean. The lure is created by a symbiotic relationship with bacteria, and it can be detached and regrown if lost. Female anglerfish are significantly larger than males and can even fuse with a male to ensure reproduction.\n\nIf you'd like to explore a different category or have a specific topic in mind, just let me know!
