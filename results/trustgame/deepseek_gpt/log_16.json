It\u2019s a versatile skill that can open up many opportunities, and you can always bake sourdough later. Plus, you can definitely have fun with it\u2014imagine naming your variables after different types of bread! \ud83e\udd56\n\n3. **Niche Hobby:** How about **soap carving**? It\u2019s a surprisingly satisfying and creative hobby where you can create intricate designs from bars of soap. Plus, it\u2019s low-cost and easy to get started with! \ud83e\uddfc\n\n4. **Optimistic Future:** There\u2019s a lot of exciting progress in renewable energy!

Ancient Greeks used it as wound dressing (modern science confirms its antibacterial properties). *Mic drop.*  \n\n2. **\ud83d\udc0d Python + Sourdough Fusion:** Why choose? Automate your baking! Use Python to:  \n   - Code a **sourdough timer** that texts you when to fold dough.  \n   - Analyze gluten development with a webcam + OpenCV.  \n   - Generate *bread-themed dad jokes* (`print(\"Why did the loaf apply for a job?
