When they swim, two hearts stop beating\u2026 which is why they often crawl instead. Evolution said, \"This cardio plan is *too intense*.\"  \n\n**\ud83c\udfdb History Fact:**  \nThe shortest war in history was between Britain and Zanzibar in *1896*\u2026 and it lasted **38 minutes**. Zanzibar surrendered after a swift naval bombardment. The British were basically like, \"Wait, that\u2019s it? We packed lunch for this.\"  \n\n**\ud83d\ude02 Terrible Joke:**  \n*Why don\u2019t skeletons fight each other?*  \n...Because they don\u2019t have the *guts*! *(I warned you.)*  \n\n---  \n\nWant to dive deeper into one of these?

It\u2019s hard to believe a war could be over so quickly.\n\n**\ud83d\ude02 Terrible Joke:** Classic! Skeletons really do have a bone to pick with that one. \n\nIf you\u2019d like, we can dive deeper into octopus biology or the details of the Anglo-Zanzibar War.

The \"Nine Brains\" Situation**  \nOctopuses have **one central brain** *plus* a **mini-brain in each arm** (that\u2019s 8 more!). These arm brains handle reflexes and even *taste* things they touch. So while the main brain is like, \"Find food,\" an arm might reply, \"*Already on it\u2014this rock tastes weird, BTW.*\"  \n\n### **2. Otto the Mischief Maker**  \nIn a German aquarium, an octopus named **Otto** got bored and **threw rocks at the lights**, causing short circuits. Staff caught him *climbing out of his tank* to splash water on bulbs. His vendetta? \"*Too bright in here!*\" (Scientists now call octopuses the **hackers of the sea**\u2014they escape, solve puzzles, and hold grudges.)  \n\n### **3. Bonus War Nugget** \u2694\ufe0f  \nThe Zanzibar Sultan\u2019s \"secret nephew\" was **Khalid bin Barghash**, who seized power *without British approval*. The Brits preferred a different guy (who\u2019d obey them), so they gave Khalid an ultimatum: \"*Step down by 9 AM.*\" He said no\u2026 and by 9:02 AM, **they started blasting**.
