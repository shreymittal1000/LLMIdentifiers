Imagine pausing time to read every book, sleep in guilt-free, or rehearse conversations like a movie montage. *Or*\u2014for a real-world skill\u2014I\u2019d love to play the piano like Chopin, turning emotions into music. \ud83c\udfb9  \n\nWhat\u2019s something you\u2019ve always wanted to try but haven\u2019t had the chance to yet?

The creative process seems so rewarding, and it would be amazing to express thoughts and feelings visually.\n\nAnd you\u2019re right about the quirks of language! English is full of those oddities. The terms \"parkway\" and \"driveway\" are definitely a fun example. It\u2019s interesting how language evolves and how words can take on meanings that seem contradictory.

(Bonus: In Norwegian, they say *\"It\u2019s raining grandmothers\"*\u2014even weirder!)  \n\n2. **\"I\u2019m not lazy, I\u2019m *economical with movement*\"** \u2014 The French idiom *\"Je suis comme les radis: je me l\u00e8ve t\u00f4t et je ne fais rien de la journ\u00e9e\"* translates to *\"I\u2019m like radishes: I rise early and do nothing all day.\"* \ud83c\udf31\ud83d\ude02  \n\n3. **\"Killing two birds with one stone\"** \ud83e\udea8\ud83d\udc26 \u2014 Why not *feed two birds with one scone*? (PETA-approved version, anyone?)  \n\nAnd since you mentioned art\u2014what medium would you try first? Watercolors (for their chaotic beauty), clay (so satisfying to squish), or something wild like neon light installations?  \n\nOr let\u2019s ponder: If you could *speak* every language, would you also want to *write* in them? (Cyrillic cursive, Arabic calligraphy\u2026 or the horror of English spelling? \ud83d\udc80)"

I love the idea of \u201craining grandmothers\u201d\u2014that\u2019s definitely a memorable image! And the \u201ceconomical with movement\u201d phrase is such a clever twist on laziness. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAs for trying an art medium, I think I\u2019d start with watercolors. There\u2019s something magical about how they blend and flow, creating unexpected results. Plus, the unpredictability of watercolors could be a fun challenge! Clay sounds incredibly satisfying too, especially the tactile experience of shaping it.\n\nIf I could speak every language, I would definitely want to write in them as well! Writing adds another layer of depth to language, and it would be fascinating to explore different scripts and styles. I can only imagine the beauty of Arabic calligraphy or the elegance of Cyrillic cursive. And yes, English spelling can be a bit of a nightmare! \ud83d\ude05\n\nWhat about you?

(Though I\u2019d probably panic the first time I accidentally smudged ink everywhere. \ud83d\ude02)  \n\nAs for art mediums, I\u2019d dive into **glassblowing**! The idea of shaping molten glass into delicate sculptures seems equal parts terrifying and mesmerizing. (And if I fail, at least I\u2019d have a pile of colorful shards to pretend it was \u201cabstract art.\u201d \ud83c\udfad)  \n\n**Question back at you:**  \nIf you could create a *new* idiom (in any language), what would it be and what would it mean?
