Revolutionary Period**  \n- Note **women\u2019s roles**:  \n  - *\"Women like Abigail Adams (\u2018Remember the ladies\u2019) and Phillis Wheatley (first published Black poet) challenged gender and racial norms, though full equality remained distant.\"*  \n\n#### **4.

WWII**  \n- Include **homefront mobilization**:  \n  - *\"Rosie the Riveter symbolized 6 million women entering wartime industries, though most were pushed out post-1945.\"*  \n\n#### **8.
