Jupiter is a gas giant, which means it doesn't have a solid surface like Earth does. Instead, it's mostly made up of hydrogen and helium gas. When Jupiter formed, it spun very quickly, and because it's so large, it has a lot of momentum. This momentum keeps Jupiter spinning rapidly, even today. Additionally, because Jupiter is so massive, its gravity pulls the gas in its atmosphere towards the center, causing the planet to bulge at the equator and flatten at the poles, as you mentioned earlier.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about other \"fastest/slowest\" planetary records or space station weirdness, just let me know!

Let\u2019s dive into **space station weirdness**\u2014I\u2019m obsessed with these:  \n\n1. **\"Growing taller\" in space**: Without gravity compressing their spines, astronauts gain **5\u20138 cm (2\u20133 inches) in height**\u2026 until they return to Earth and shrink back. Ouch!  \n2. **Water bubbles are deadly**: In microgravity, water forms floating blobs that can short-circuit equipment\u2014or get inhaled by astronauts (a serious drowning risk!).  \n3. **Sunrises every 90 minutes**: The ISS orbits Earth 16 times a day, so crews see 16 sunrises/sunsets in 24 hours.  \n\nWant more?

Let's dive deeper into some more space station weirdness:\n\n4. **Space food smells and tastes different**: In microgravity, astronauts often report that food smells and tastes differently. This is due to the fact that fluid shifts in the body, causing congestion in the sinuses and affecting the sense of smell and taste.\n\n5. **Astronauts' eyes change shape**: Prolonged exposure to microgravity can cause changes in the shape of astronauts' eyes, leading to a condition known as Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-Ocular Syndrome (SANS). This can result in temporary changes in vision.\n\n6. **Fire behaves strangely**: Fire in microgravity burns differently than it does on Earth. Flames are spherical and burn at a lower temperature, making them easier to control but also harder to extinguish. This is why fire safety is a critical concern on the ISS.\n\n7. **Astronauts' muscles and bones weaken**: Without the constant pull of gravity, astronauts' muscles and bones begin to atrophy. They can lose up to 1-2% of their bone density per month in space, which is why they exercise for about 2 hours a day to mitigate these effects.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about Jupiter's stormy secrets or human body trivia, just let me know!

They\u2019ve stayed locked in place for years\u2014no one knows why.  \n3. **Lightning 1,000x Stronger than Earth\u2019s**: Jupiter\u2019s storms crackle with *ammonia-water* lightning, but it\u2019s mostly deep under clouds.
