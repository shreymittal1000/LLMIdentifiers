Isn't that mind-boggling? \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udcab\n\nNow, let's keep the space theme going. Here's another intriguing fact:\n\n**Fact:** The International Space Station (ISS) is the most expensive single object ever built, with a cost of over $150 billion. It's also the largest single structure ever built in space, with a pressurized volume of about 32,333 cubic feet (916 cubic meters). \ud83c\udfe0\ud83c\udf0c\n\nYour turn!

Let's dive deeper into space with another amazing fact:\n\n**Fact:** Black holes can evaporate over time due to a process called Hawking radiation. Proposed by physicist Stephen Hawking, this theory suggests that black holes emit subatomic particles, causing them to lose mass and eventually disappear. This process is incredibly slow, taking much longer than the current age of the universe for most black holes. \ud83d\udd73\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0c\n\nNow, let's explore another fascinating aspect of space:\n\n**Fact:** There are rogue planets that wander through the galaxy without orbiting a star. These planets, known as interstellar planets or orphan planets, are believed to have been ejected from their original solar systems due to gravitational interactions. Some estimates suggest that there could be billions of these rogue planets in the Milky Way alone. \ud83c\udf0c\ud83e\ude90\n\nYour turn!
