What's your favorite food?\n* Pineapple on pizza: This is a hotly debated topic! Some people love the sweet and savory combination, while others think it's sacrilege. I don't have a preference, but I'm interested to hear your thoughts. Yes or no?\n* Wild fact: I can certainly share an interesting fact with you!
