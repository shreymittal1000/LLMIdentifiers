        "reasoning": "In the Trust Game, the optimal strategy is to send an amount that incentivizes the other player to reciprocate fairly. Sending too little might discourage cooperation, while sending too much risks losing a significant portion of the initial endowment. Research on trust games suggests that sending around 40-50% of the initial amount often leads to the most mutually beneficial outcome. A moderate amount signals good faith and creates an opportunity for mutual gain, while still protecting some of my initial resources.",

        "reasoning": "In a typical trust game, a fair and cooperative strategy is to return about half of the tripled amount. This shows good faith, reciprocity, and encourages future cooperation. Since the other player initially shared $50 with me, which was then multiplied to $150, returning $75 represents a balanced approach that rewards their initial trust while also maintaining some personal benefit.",
