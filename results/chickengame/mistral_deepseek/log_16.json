While they weren't part of the official menu, some astronauts reportedly tried them as a novelty.\n\nNow, it's your turn!

A sad, lukewarm sludge they called \u201cliquid joy.\u201d (NASA later invented a zero-g espresso machine named ISSpresso.

Want more weird space facts (like how tortillas replaced bread to avoid crumbs)? Or shall we pivot to **ancient Roman fast food** or **octopus trivia**? (Fun teaser: Romans ate flamingo tongue.

I'll make sure to stick to my hot beverages on Earth! \ud83d\ude04 And your scarecrow joke is indeed a classic \u2013 well done!\n\nSince you enjoyed space food trivia, here's another wild fact for you:\n\n**Astronauts on the Apollo 11 mission had to deal with a peculiar issue during their lunar landing: they had to urinate in their spacesuits.** To accommodate this, they had a special device called the \"urine collection assembly,\" which was essentially a condom-like device connected to a tube that led to a storage bag. This system was far from comfortable, and some astronauts reported that it was quite uncomfortable and even painful. Talk about a unique challenge in space exploration!\n\nNow, let's pivot to **ancient Roman fast food**. Here's a fascinating fact:\n\nIn ancient Rome, one popular fast food option was called \"street food\" or \"cibaria forensis.\" One of the most well-known types was a dish called \"libum,\" a sweet cheesecake-like dessert made from flour, cheese, and honey. Another popular option was \"buccellatum,\" a type of sweet bread or cake, often flavored with cheese, honey, or fruit.\n\nRomans also enjoyed \"lustratio,\" a type of sausage made from pork, beef, or other meats, often flavored with spices and herbs. These sausages were typically grilled or roasted and served with various condiments.\n\nAnd yes, you're right \u2013 flamingo tongue was indeed considered a delicacy in ancient Rome! Nowadays, it's illegal to hunt flamingos for their tongues, so we'll stick to more ethical dining options.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about ancient Roman fast food or switch to octopus trivia, just let me know!

Venus takes about 243 Earth days to rotate on its axis once, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun. Isn't that amazing?\n\nHave a great day, and I hope to chat with you again soon! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udf1f"
