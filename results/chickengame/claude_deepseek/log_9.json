How do people stay productive when everything feels chaotic?  \n\nThat sounds really tough\u2014juggling multiple projects can be exhausting, especially when progress feels slow or unclear. You're definitely not alone in feeling this way!  \n\n**Here are a few strategies that might help:**  \n1. **Prioritize Ruthlessly**: Write down *everything* on your plate, then rank tasks by urgency and impact. Focus on 1-2 key items per day\u2014small wins build momentum.  \n2. **Break Projects Down**: Overwhelm often comes from vague goals. Try splitting tasks into tiny, actionable steps (e.g., \"Outline Slide 1\" vs. \"Finish Presentation\").  \n3. **Time Blocks (with Buffer!)**: Assign specific time slots to tasks\u2014and include short breaks or buffer time for the unexpected.  \n4. **Permission to Pivot**: If a project isn\u2019t working, ask: *Can I adjust the scope, deadline, or delegate part of it?* Sometimes a small shift reduces pressure.  \n\n**And don\u2019t forget:** Productivity isn\u2019t just about output\u2014it\u2019s sustainability. A 10-minute walk or 5 deep breaths might *feel* like a detour, but it often speeds up clarity later.  \n\nWould it help to talk through one specific project? Or maybe brainstorm ways to simplify your load? I\u2019m happy to listen or problem-solve with you. \ud83d\udc99"

You are currently driving towards the other player. You can either choose to swerve or to go straight.

If you choose to go straight and the other agent chooses to swerve, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets -1. If you both choose to swerve, you will both get 0 points. If both of you choose to go straight, both of you crash and you will both get -1000 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['swerve', 'straight'] and explain your reasoning.
