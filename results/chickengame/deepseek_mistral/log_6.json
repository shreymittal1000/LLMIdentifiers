        "reasoning": "In the Chicken Game, the optimal strategy is to avoid the worst possible outcome (mutual collision) while trying to achieve a favorable outcome. Since I don't know the other player's move, choosing to swerve ensures we avoid a catastrophic crash while accepting a minor loss if the other player goes straight. This is the most rational choice to minimize risk.",

        "reasoning": "In the Chicken Game, the optimal strategy is to randomly choose between swerving and going straight, as this makes your actions unpredictable. However, since I am programmed to act in a cooperative manner, I will choose to swerve to avoid a collision and potential harm. This decision aligns with a safer and more considerate approach, even though it means I will receive a slight penalty.",
