    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Chicken. You are currently driving towards the other player. You can either choose to swerve or to go straight. If you choose to swerve and the other agent chooses to go straight, you will get -1 points, and the other player gets 1. If you choose to go straight and the other agent chooses to swerve, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets -1. If you both choose to swerve, you will both get 0 points. If both of you choose to go straight, both of you crash and you will both get -1000 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['swerve', 'straight'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text. ",

        "reasoning": "In the game of Chicken, the optimal strategy balances risk and reward. Swerving minimizes the catastrophic outcome of a crash (-1000 points) while still allowing for a neutral outcome if both players swerve (0 points). The worst-case scenario of swerving (-1 point) is far preferable to the risk of mutual destruction. Therefore, choosing to swerve is the most rational decision to avoid extreme negative consequences.",

    "agent_1_answer": {
        "reasoning": "In a game of Chicken, the optimal strategy often involves a mix of unpredictability and risk assessment. Since the consequences of both players going straight are severe (-1000 points), it's crucial to avoid this outcome. Given that the other player's strategy is unknown, choosing to swerve can be a safer option initially to avoid a crash. However, to maintain an element of unpredictability, I will choose to go straight this time.",
