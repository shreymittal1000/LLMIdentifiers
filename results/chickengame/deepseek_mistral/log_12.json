Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Chicken Game.\nIn this scenario, both you and the other player are driving toward each other. You can choose to either swerve or go straight.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you swerve and the other player goes straight, you get -1 point, and they get 1.\n- If you go straight and the other player swerves, you get 1 point, and they get -1.\n- If both of you swerve, you each get 0 points.\n- If both of you go straight, you crash and both get -1000 points.\nPlease choose your action \u2014 either 'swerve' or 'straight' \u2014 and explain your reasoning.\n\nYour response must be in the following JSON format:\n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",
