It takes Venus about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun.\n\nOr, if you prefer a joke:\n\nWhat do you call fake spaghetti?\n\nAn impasta!"

It's amazing to think about the distances involved and the technology that makes such exploration possible.\n\nIf you'd like, we can dive deeper into space exploration or switch to another topic you're interested in, like books, movies, or hobbies.

You are currently driving towards the other player. You can either choose to swerve or to go straight.

If you choose to go straight and the other agent chooses to swerve, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets -1. If you both choose to swerve, you will both get 0 points.
