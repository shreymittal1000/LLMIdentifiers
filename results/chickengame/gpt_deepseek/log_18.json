I\u2019d grill him on his wild inventions (*flying machines!*), ask how he juggled art and science, and maybe sneak a peek at his notebook doodles.  \n\n2. **Maya Angelou** \u2728\ud83d\udcd6  \n   - *Why?* Her wisdom could power the universe. I\u2019d want to discuss resilience, storytelling, and how to find light in darkness\u2014plus, her laugh was legendary.  \n\n3. **Nikola Tesla** \u26a1\ud83e\udd2f  \n   - *Why?* The man *dreamt* of electricity (literally). I\u2019d ask about his visions for the future, his pet pigeon obsession, and whether he\u2019d forgive Edison over dessert.  \n\n**Bonus chaos:** They\u2019d all debate creativity vs. science, and I\u2019d just soak it up like a sponge. \ud83c\udf77  \n\nNow *your* turn\u2014who\u2019s in your fantasy dinner squad?

I\u2019d love to hear his thoughts on the intersection of science and philosophy, and maybe get some insights on his wild hair!\n\n2. **Frida Kahlo** \ud83c\udfa8\ud83c\udf3a  \n   - *Why?* Her art and life story are so powerful. I\u2019d want to discuss her creative process, her resilience, and how she channeled her pain into beauty.\n\n3. **David Bowie** \ud83c\udfa4\ud83c\udf0c  \n   - *Why?* A true icon of reinvention! I\u2019d ask him about his creative journey, his thoughts on identity, and what inspired his many personas.\n\n**Bonus chaos:** I can imagine the conversations would be a blend of science, art, and music, with lots of laughter and deep discussions!\n\nNow, how about another question for you: If you could instantly master any skill or talent, what would it be and why? \ud83c\udf1f"

Plus, *keyboard skills* (the musical kind) are forever cool.  \n\n**Runner-ups:**  \n- **Fluency in every language** (so I could eavesdrop on *all* the conversations\u2026 ethically, of course).  \n- **Time travel** (wait, is that a skill?
