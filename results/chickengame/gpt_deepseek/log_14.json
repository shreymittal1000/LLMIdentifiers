Here\u2019s another **weird-but-true fact** that\u2019ll make you see the world differently:  \n\n### **Bananas Are Berries, But Strawberries Aren\u2019t** \ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf53  \n- Botanically speaking, a *berry* is a fruit produced from a *single ovary* and has seeds embedded in the flesh. By that definition:  \n  - **Bananas, pumpkins, and kiwis** are berries.  \n  - **Strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries**? Nope\u2014they\u2019re \u201caggregate fruits\u201d (formed from multiple ovaries).  \n\n**Why?** Strawberries\u2019 seeds are on the *outside* (each tiny speck is technically its own fruit!), while banana seeds are so tiny we don\u2019t even notice them. Nature\u2019s trolling us.  \n\n---\n\n### **Extra Bonus Facts** (because why stop now?):  \n1. **Octopuses Have Three Hearts** \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f  \n   - Two pump blood to the gills, one to the body. And when they swim, the *main heart stops beating*. No wonder they prefer crawling!  \n\n2. **A Group of Flamingos Is Called a \u201cFlamboyance\u201d** \ud83e\udda9  \n   - (Also acceptable: \u201cstand,\u201d \u201ccolony,\u201d or just *pure drama*.)  \n\n3. **The Eiffel Tower Grows in Summer** \ud83d\uddfc  \n   - Heat expands the iron, making it up to *6 inches taller* on hot days.  \n\n4. **You Can\u2019t Hum While Holding Your Nose** \ud83e\udd10  \n   - Try it! Humming requires air to flow through your nose, so pinching it silences you instantly.  \n\n---\n\nWant to dive deeper into any of these? Or should I unleash *more*?

Here\u2019s the scoop (pun intended):  \n\n### **Why Wombat Poop is Cubed** \ud83d\udca9\u2666\ufe0f  \n1. **The Only Cubic Poop in Nature**: Wombats (adorable, chunky Aussie marsupials) produce poop that\u2019s *literally cube-shaped*\u2014no squeezing or molding required. Scientists even tested it by squishing fresh poop\u2026 and it *bounced back into cubes*!  \n\n2. **How? It\u2019s All About the Intestines**:  \n   - Wombats have super-long digestive tracts (up to **10 feet**!) with a unique *two-tiered structure* in the last 8% of their intestines.  \n   - The intestine stretches unevenly: **stiffer edges + stretchy grooves** = natural cube-forming pressure.  \n   - By the time it exits, the poop is pre-sliced by nature. Efficiency!  \n\n3. **Why Cubes?**  \n   - **Territorial Marking**: Wombats stack their poop on rocks/logs to communicate via scent. Cubes don\u2019t roll away\u2014like furry little Excel spreadsheets of information.  \n   - **Evolutionary Genius**: Rolls would tumble off hills; cubes stay put.  \n\n---\n\n### **Extra Wombat Weirdness**  \n- **Bony Butts**: Their rear ends are mostly cartilage, so predators can\u2019t bite easily. They\u2019ll even **crush intruders\u2019 skulls** against tunnel walls! (Wombats are hardcore.)  \n- **Glow-in-the-Dark Fur**: Under UV light, their fur fluoresces **pink and blue**\u2014scientists still don\u2019t know why.  \n\n**TL;DR**: Wombats are the undisputed champions of biological engineering. Who needs 3D printers when you\u2019ve got intestines?  \n\n---  \nWant more weird science?

However, there's also an incentive to betray (go straight) if you think the other will swerve.
