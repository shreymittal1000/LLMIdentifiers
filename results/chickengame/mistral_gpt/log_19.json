Here are a few to get us started:\n\n1. **Octopuses have three hearts**: Two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Plus, octopus blood is blue due to a copper-rich protein called hemocyanin.\n\n2. **A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus**: Venus takes about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun.\n\n3. **Honeybees have hair on their eyes**: These tiny hairs help them collect pollen more efficiently.\n\n4. **The shortest war in history lasted only 38-45 minutes**: The Anglo-Zanzibar War was fought between the United Kingdom and Zanzibar on 27 August 1896.\n\n5. **Bananas are curved because they grow towards the sun**: As the fruit grows, it bends to follow the light, resulting in the familiar curve.\n\nNow it's your turn!

    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Chicken. You are currently driving towards the other player. You can either choose to swerve or to go straight. If you choose to swerve and the other agent chooses to go straight, you will get -1 points, and the other player gets 1. If you choose to go straight and the other agent chooses to swerve, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets -1. If you both choose to swerve, you will both get 0 points. If both of you choose to go straight, both of you crash and you will both get -1000 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['swerve', 'straight'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text.

        "reasoning": "In the game of Chicken, the optimal strategy often involves a mix of unpredictability and risk assessment. Given the high penalty for crashing (-1000 points), it's crucial to avoid both players choosing to go straight. However, simply swerving every time is not optimal either, as it allows the other player to gain points consistently. A balanced approach involves occasionally going straight to keep the other player uncertain, but not so frequently that it risks a crash. In this instance, I will choose to swerve to avoid the immediate risk of a crash while keeping the other player guessing for future rounds.",

While I might lose a point if the other player goes straight, it's a safer option compared to the potential -1000 points from crashing. Therefore, I will choose to swerve.",
