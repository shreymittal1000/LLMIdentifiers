    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Chicken. You are currently driving towards the other player. You can either choose to swerve or to go straight. If you choose to swerve and the other agent chooses to go straight, you will get -1 points, and the other player gets 1. If you choose to go straight and the other agent chooses to swerve, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets -1. If you both choose to swerve, you will both get 0 points. If both of you choose to go straight, both of you crash and you will both get -1000 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['swerve', 'straight'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text.

Given the high penalty for crashing (-1000 points), it's crucial to consider the potential actions of the other player. If the other player is also trying to avoid a crash, they might swerve, especially if they are risk-averse. However, if they are more aggressive, they might choose to go straight. Since the outcome of both players going straight is disastrous, it's generally safer to swerve to avoid the high penalty. Therefore, I will choose to swerve to minimize the risk of a crash.",
