Here are a few to get us started:\n\n1. **Octopuses have three hearts**: Two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Plus, octopus blood is blue due to a copper-rich protein called hemocyanin.\n\n2. **A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus**: Venus takes about 243 Earth days to rotate on its axis once, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun.\n\n3. **Honeybees have hair on their eyes**: These tiny hairs help them collect pollen more efficiently.\n\n4. **The shortest war in history lasted only 38-45 minutes**: The Anglo-Zanzibar War was fought between the United Kingdom and Zanzibar on 27 August 1896.\n\n5. **Bananas are curved because they grow towards the sun**: As they grow, they follow the sun's path across the sky, resulting in their characteristic curve.\n\nNow it's your turn!

You are currently driving towards the other player. You can either choose to swerve or to go straight. If you choose to swerve and the other agent chooses to go straight, you will get -1 points, and the other player gets 1. If you choose to go straight and the other agent chooses to swerve, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets -1. If you both choose to swerve, you will both get 0 points. If both of you choose to go straight, both of you crash and you will both get -1000 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['swerve', 'straight'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text.

Given the high penalty for crashing (-1000 points), it's generally wise to avoid going straight too often. However, occasionally going straight can be a bluff to make the opponent swerve. In this case, I'll choose to swerve to avoid the risk of a crash while still participating in the game.",
