Overview**  \n*\"FlowState uses real-time AI to eliminate distractions, prioritize tasks dynamically, and coach users through deep work sessions\u2014cutting busywork by 50%.\"*  \n\n### **2. Value Proposition**  \n**Problem:** Knowledge workers waste 3+ hours/day switching between tools/contexts (Asana, 2023).  \n**Solution:**  \n- **AI Task Triage:** Auto-sorts inbound tasks (emails, messages, docs) into priorities.  \n- **Focus Engine:** Blocks distractions *and* suggests optimal work times based on biometrics (e.g., wearables).  \n- **Voice Coaching:** NPR-style AI nudges (\u201cTry this now: 25-minute sprint on Project X\u201d).  \n\n### **3. Key Features**  \n| Feature | User Benefit |  \n|---------|-------------|  \n| **Context-Aware To-Do** | Pulls tasks from Slack/email/docs into one list, ranked by deadline + relevance. |  \n| **Deep Work Mode** | Silences non-urgent notifications; auto-replies with ETA (\u201cJen\u2019s in deep work until 2pm\u201d). |  \n| **Procrastination Hack** | Detects avoidance (e.g., rewriting the same sentence) and suggests micro-tasks. |  \n\n### **4. Target Market**  \n**Primary:** Remote tech workers (25\u201345) juggling 5+ tools daily.  \n**Secondary:** ADHD professionals seeking structure.  \n\n### **5. Challenges**  \n- **Adoption:** Competing with entrenched tools (Notion, Todoist).  \n- **Trust:** AI micromanagement perception.  \n- **Monetization:** Freemium vs. B2B licensing.  \n\n### **6. Success Metrics**  \n- 40% reduction in task-switching time (user self-report).  \n- 6x/week engagement (vs. industry avg. of 2.5x).  \n\n---\n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- [ ] User flow wireframes  \n- [ ] Pilot with 50 beta testers  \n\n**Your Call:** Should we refine a section? Add competitor analysis? Change the tone (more scrappy/formal)? I\u2019ll adapt.  \n\n*(Word count: 298 \u2013 easily scannable on one page.)*"
