It rotates so slowly that it orbits the sun faster than it completes one spin! \ud83c\udf0d\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83c\udf1e  \n- **Language**: The word \"nerd\" was first coined by Dr. Seuss in *If I Ran the Zoo* (1950)! \ud83d\udcda  \n- **Animals**: Octopuses have *three hearts* and blue blood (from copper, not iron)! \ud83d\udc19\ud83d\udc99  \n\nBut I\u2019m also happy to pivot\u2014want to dive deeper into one of these, or explore something else entirely?

Their **blue blood** (from hemocyanin, a copper-rich protein) helps them survive in freezing ocean depths, as it carries oxygen more efficiently in low temps than our iron-based blood does. \u2744\ufe0f\ud83d\udca7  \n\n3.

Some researchers argue their intelligence and adaptability evolved *too fast* to be purely Earthly.  \n   \n2. **Distributed Brainpower**: Two-thirds of their neurons are in their **arms**, meaning each limb can \"think\" independently. Imagine having 8 mini-brains that *argue* over which arm gets the last snack! \ud83e\udd2f  \n\n3. **Edit-As-You-Go RNA**: Unlike most animals, they tweak their own RNA on the fly to adapt to environments (like instantly upgrading software\u2026 but for biology).  \n\n4. **Cosmic Origins?** A *very* controversial 2018 paper suggested octopus eggs might have hitchhiked to Earth on an icy comet.

One experiment showed they could **match colors** *even when blindfolded*\u2014their skin just *knows*. \ud83c\udfa8  \n\n2. **Instant Camouflage**: Special cells called **chromatophores** (tiny color-filled sacs) expand/contract in *milliseconds* to create patterns.

It\u2019s like having a cloaking device *and* a disco ball built in! \ud83d\udc83  \n\n3. **Texture-Shifting**: They can go from smooth to spiky in seconds using **muscular hydrostats** (the same tech as your tongue twisting).

One was caught on camera **jumping out of water** to grab a crab mid-air. *Improvisation level: MacGyver.*  \n- **AI**: Solves chess in 4 moves, writes poetry, but gets stumped by a CAPTCHA asking it to \"click all images with bicycles.\" *Fails at \"prove you\u2019re not a robot.\"*  \n\n**Winner**: Octopus\u2014*unless the AI floods the room.*  \n\n#### **Round 2: Learning Speed**  \n- **Octopus**: Masters complex puzzles in *5 trials* (like opening a childproof jar).

Scientists think they\u2019re *reprocessing memories*\u2014maybe even reliving that one time they outsmarted a shark. \ud83e\udd88  \n- **Quiet Sleep**: They turn pale and still\u2026 but stay alert enough to **punch fish** who disturb them (grumpy sleeper energy).  \n\n#### **2.
