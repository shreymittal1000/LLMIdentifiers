They appear in the Old Testament books of Exodus and Deuteronomy. According to the biblical narrative, the commandments were written by God and given to Moses on Mount Sinai, inscribed on two stone tablets. These commandments are considered divine laws that outline the Israelites' covenant with God and provide a moral framework for living a righteous life. They cover various aspects of human behavior, including the worship of God, respect for parents, prohibitions against murder, theft, adultery, false testimony, and coveting. The Ten Commandments have had a profound influence on religious thought, legal systems, and moral teachings throughout history.\n\n## Exodus 20:1\u201317\n\n1 And God spake all these words, saying, 2 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: 5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; 6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. 7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: 11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. 12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. 13 Thou shalt not kill. 14 Thou shalt not commit adultery. 15 Thou shalt not steal. 16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. 17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's. (Exodus 20:1-17, KJV)\n\n## The 10 Commandments\n\n### 1.

Honor your father and your mother.\n\nThis commandment calls for respect, obedience, and care for one's parents, recognizing their role as God's representatives in the family. It promises blessings for those who honor their parents, contributing to societal stability and generational continuity.\n\n### 6. You shall not murder.\n\nThis commandment prohibits the unlawful taking of human life, affirming the sanctity of life as created in God's image. It establishes the foundation for laws protecting human life and promotes peace and respect among individuals.\n\n### 7.

It promotes truthfulness, integrity, and trustworthiness in all areas of life, essential for healthy relationships and communities.\n\n### 10. You shall not covet.\n\nThis commandment addresses the inner attitude of the heart, prohibiting envy or desire for what belongs to another.

Since mutual destruction (both going straight) is the worst outcome, and assuming the other player is rational and wants to avoid catastrophe, the safest move is to swerve to guarantee at least a neutral outcome rather than risk a crash.",
