They are found in the Bible in Exodus 20:1-17 and Deuteronomy 5:4-21. These commandments were given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai and are considered divine laws for moral living. Below is a list of the Ten Commandments as traditionally understood in Christian traditions, along with brief explanations:\n\n## 1. You shall have no other gods before me.\n\nThis commandment establishes monotheism, the belief in one God, and demands exclusive loyalty to Yahweh, the God of Israel. It prohibits the worship of any other deities or idols, emphasizing that God alone is worthy of worship and devotion.\n\n## 2. You shall not make for yourself a carved image.\n\nThis commandment forbids the creation and worship of idols or any graven images intended to represent God. It underscores that God is spirit and cannot be adequately represented by physical forms, and warns against reducing the divine to human-made objects.\n\n## 3. You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.\n\nThis commandment prohibits the misuse of God\u2019s name, including false oaths, blasphemy, or using God\u2019s name frivolously or deceitfully. It calls for reverence and respect toward the name of God, recognizing its holiness.\n\n## 4. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.\n\nThis commandment instructs the observance of the Sabbath (the seventh day) as a day of rest and worship, commemorating God\u2019s rest on the seventh day of creation. It is a time set apart for spiritual renewal and ceasing from regular labor.\n\n## 5. Honor your father and your mother.\n\nThis commandment calls for respect, obedience, and care toward one\u2019s parents. It establishes the family as a foundational institution in society and promises blessings for those who honor their parents, contributing to societal stability and generational continuity.\n\n## 6. You shall not murder.\n\nThis commandment prohibits the unlawful taking of human life, recognizing the sanctity of life as created in God\u2019s image. It establishes the protection of life as a fundamental moral principle, though it does not necessarily condemn all forms of killing (e.g., capital punishment or war in certain contexts).\n\n## 7. You shall not commit adultery.\n\nThis commandment forbids sexual relations outside the covenant of marriage, upholding the sanctity of the marital bond. It promotes fidelity, trust, and purity within marriage, which is designed to reflect God\u2019s covenantal faithfulness.\n\n## 8. You shall not steal.\n\nThis commandment prohibits taking what rightfully belongs to another, whether property, possessions, or even intangible things like identity or opportunities. It upholds the principles of honesty, respect for others\u2019 rights, and fair dealings.\n\n## 9. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.\n\nThis commandment forbids lying, especially in legal settings where false testimony could harm an innocent person. It promotes truthfulness, integrity, and justice in all forms of communication and relationships.\n\n## 10. You shall not covet.\n\nThis commandment addresses the inner attitude of the heart, prohibiting envy or desire for what belongs to another\u2014whether possessions, relationships, or status. It calls for contentment and warns against allowing selfish desires to lead to sinful actions.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe Ten Commandments serve as a moral and spiritual foundation, guiding believers in their relationship with God and with others. They emphasize love for God (the first four commandments) and love for neighbor (the last six), reflecting Jesus\u2019 summary of the law in Matthew 22:37-40. While given in the context of the Old Covenant, they continue to inform Christian ethics and are seen as reflecting God\u2019s eternal moral standards. Different religious traditions may number or interpret them slightly differently, but their core principles remain universally significant."

Here\u2019s a slightly refined version with added context and formatting for readability:\n\n---\n\n### **The Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:1\u201317, Deuteronomy 5:4\u201321)**  \nA divine moral code given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai, foundational to Judeo-Christian ethics.  \n\n#### **Commandments About Our Relationship with God**  \n1. **No other gods before Me.**  \n   - Rejects polytheism/idolatry; demands exclusive worship of Yahweh.  \n2. **No graven images.**  \n   - Forbids idol-making or reducing God to physical representations.  \n3. **Do not misuse God\u2019s name.**  \n   - Prohibits blasphemy, false oaths, or trivializing God\u2019s holiness.  \n4. **Keep the Sabbath holy.**  \n   - A day of rest/worship, mirroring God\u2019s creation rhythm (Exodus 20:11).  \n\n#### **Commandments About Our Relationship with Others**  \n5. **Honor parents.**  \n   - Promotes family stability; ties respect for parents to societal flourishing.  \n6. **Do not murder.**  \n   - Protects the sanctity of human life (Genesis 9:6).  \n7. **Do not commit adultery.**  \n   - Guards marital fidelity; reflects God\u2019s covenant faithfulness.  \n8. **Do not steal.**  \n   - Upholds property rights and justice in economic dealings.  \n9. **Do not lie (bear false witness).**  \n   - Especially in court, but extends to truthfulness in all life.  \n10. **Do not covet.**  \n    - Condemns envy of others\u2019 possessions, relationships, or status.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Themes**  \n- **Monotheism vs. Idolatry:** Commandments 1\u20134 focus on undivided devotion to God.  \n- **Love for Neighbor:** Commandments 5\u201310 summarize ethical treatment of others (cf. Romans 13:9).  \n- **Heart and Action:** The 10th commandment uniquely addresses internal sin (coveting), showing God\u2019s concern for motives (Matthew 5:28).  \n\n### **Christian Perspective**  \n- Jesus affirmed the Commandments (Matthew 19:17\u201319) but emphasized their spirit over legalism (e.g., Sabbath for mercy, Mark 2:27).  \n- Paul notes the Law exposes sin (Romans 3:20) but salvation is through Christ, not rule-keeping (Galatians 3:24).  \n\nWould you like a comparison with how Jewish traditions number them (e.g., combining 1\u20132 or splitting coveting)?"

Preamble (Ex. 20:2)  \n2. No other gods/idols (Ex. 20:3\u20136)  \n3. No blasphemy (Ex. 20:7)  \n...  \n10. No coveting (Ex. 20:14)  \n\n**Catholic/Lutheran:**  \n1. No other gods (Ex. 20:3)  \n2. No idols (Ex. 20:4\u20136)  \n3. Keep Sabbath (Ex. 20:8\u201311)  \n...  \n9. No coveting neighbor\u2019s wife  \n10. No coveting neighbor\u2019s goods  \n\n**Protestant:**  \n1.

No coveting (Ex. 20:17)  \n\n---\n\n### **Did This Affect the Content?**  \nNo\u2014the **substance** remains the same across traditions.

            "content": "Here\u2019s a concise breakdown of how **numbering differences** in the Ten Commandments translate into **real-world religious practices**, with key examples:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Sabbath Observance (4th Commandment in Protestant/Jewish; 3rd in Catholic/Lutheran)**  \n- **Jewish Tradition (Shabbat):**  \n  - Strict rest from Friday sunset to Saturday night (Exodus 20:8\u201311).  \n  - Prohibitions: No work, lighting fires, using electronics (based on Talmudic interpretation).  \n- **Protestant (e.g., Reformed):**  \n  - Sunday observance (linking to Christ\u2019s resurrection), but often less strict\u2014focus on worship, not legalism (Colossians 2:16).  \n- **Catholic/Lutheran:**  \n  - Sunday as the \"Lord\u2019s Day\" (Catechism 2176). Required Mass attendance, but manual labor restrictions relaxed vs. Judaism.  \n\n**Why it matters:** The numbering shift (3rd vs. 4th) doesn\u2019t change the command but reflects **prioritization**\u2014Jews and Protestants emphasize Sabbath as a creation ordinance, while Catholics group it under \"love of God.\"\n\n---\n\n### **2. Use of Religious Art (2nd Commandment Debate)**  \n- **Jewish/Protestant (Strict View):**  \n  - No statues/icons of God (Exodus 20:4\u20135). Reformed churches often have plain crosses or abstract symbols.  \n  - *Exception:* Some Anglicans/Lutherans allow stained glass or crosses but reject veneration.  \n- **Catholic/Orthodox (Non-Literal View):**  \n  - Distinguish between *worship* (for God alone) and *veneration* (honoring saints via images).  \n  - Icons, statues, and crucifixes are permitted (defended at the 7th Ecumenical Council, 787 AD).  \n\n**Key Difference:** Catholics omit the Protestant 2nd Commandment\u2019s phrasing to accommodate religious art, merging it with the 1st Commandment.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Coveting (Split vs. Combined in 10th Commandment)**  \n- **Jewish/Protestant:**  \n  - Single command against all coveting (Exodus 20:17)\u2014focus on **internal purity** (e.g., envy of wealth, spouse, status).  \n- **Catholic/Lutheran:**  \n  - Split into two commands to retain the number 10:  \n    - *9th:* \"You shall not covet your neighbor\u2019s wife\" (prioritizing marital fidelity).  \n    - *10th:* \"You shall not covet your neighbor\u2019s goods\" (material envy).  \n\n**Practical Impact:**  \n- Catholics emphasize **distinct moral categories** (lust vs. greed).  \n- Protestants stress **heart attitude** as the root of sin (Matthew 5:28).  \n\n---\n\n### **4. \"I am the Lord Your God\" (Preamble or 1st Commandment?)**  \n- **Jewish View:**  \n  - Exodus 20:2 is the **preamble**, establishing God\u2019s authority before listing commands.  \n- **Christian View:**  \n  - Treated as the **1st Commandment** (affirming monotheism).  \n\n**Why?** Judaism sees it as context; Christianity views it as an active command to acknowledge God\u2019s sovereignty.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table: Practice vs. Tradition**  \n| **Issue**          | Jewish Practice          | Catholic/Lutheran Practice | Protestant Practice       |  \n|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|  \n| **Sabbath**        | Saturday, strict rest    | Sunday, Mass obligation    | Sunday, worship-focused  |  \n| **Religious Art**  | No images of God         | Icons/statues permitted    | Minimalist (no icons)    |  \n| **Coveting**       | One broad prohibition    | Split: wife vs. possessions | One heart-focused command |  \n\n---\n\n### **Why These Differences?**  \n- **Cultural Context:** Jewish practices stem from Torah/Talmud; Christian traditions reflect theological debates (e.g., Reformation\u2019s rejection of icons).  \n- **Theological Priorities:** Protestants emphasize Scripture\u2019s literal text; Catholics allow tradition to shape interpretation.  \n\nWould you like deeper historical examples (e.g., how the Reformation sparked the Protestant numbering)? \ud83d\ude0a"

            "content": "Here\u2019s a focused look at how the **Reformation directly shaped the Protestant numbering** of the Ten Commandments, with historical examples and lasting impacts:\n\n---\n\n### **How the Reformation Changed the Commandments' Numbering**  \n#### **1. The Catholic (Augustinian) System Pre-Reformation**  \n- **Structure:**  \n  - **1st Commandment:** Combined \"no other gods\" (Ex. 20:3) and \"no idols\" (Ex. 20:4\u20136).  \n  - **2nd Commandment:** \"No misuse of God\u2019s name\" (Ex. 20:7).  \n  - **10th Commandment:** Split coveting into two parts (wife vs. goods).  \n- **Why?** Early Church Fathers like Augustine (4th century) merged the bans on gods/idols to **accommodate religious art** (e.g., crucifixes, saints\u2019 statues).  \n\n#### **2. Luther\u2019s Challenge (16th Century)**  \n- **Martin Luther** kept Catholic numbering but **rejected icon veneration** theologically.  \n- **Key Tension:** He criticized the sale of indulgences but didn\u2019t radically alter the Commandments\u2019 structure, focusing instead on their spiritual meaning.  \n\n#### **3. The Reformed Break: Calvin and Knox**  \n- **John Calvin\u2019s Revisions:**  \n  - **Restored \"no idols\" as the 2nd Commandment** (Ex. 20:4\u20136), calling Catholic art \"idolatrous.\"  \n  - **Condensed coveting** back into one command (Ex. 20:17).  \n- **Impact:**  \n  - Protestant catechisms (e.g., Westminster, Heidelberg) adopted this numbering.  \n  - **Visual Purges:** Reformed churches destroyed statues/stained glass (1566 Beeldenstorm in Netherlands).  \n\n#### **4. Anglican Middle Ground**  \n- **Retained Catholic numbering** but with Reformed theology (e.g., 39 Articles reject \"worship\" of images).  \n- **Result:** Split coveting but discouraged icon veneration.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Reformation Conflicts Over the Commandments**  \n1. **The \"Idol\" Debate (2nd Commandment):**  \n   - **Catholic View:** Art aids devotion; veneration \u2260 worship.  \n   - **Protestant View:** \"Graven images\" violate Scripture (Ex. 20:4).  \n   - **Violence:** Calvinists smashed Catholic statues; Catholics accused Protestants of \"Bible-only\" extremism.  \n\n2. **Sabbath (3rd/4th Commandment):**  \n   - **Luther:** Relaxed Sunday rules (\"Christian freedom\").  \n   - **Calvin:** Strict Sunday observance (Geneva banned games, markets).  \n\n3. **Coveting (10th Commandment):**  \n   - **Protestants** linked it to **total depravity** (sin starts in the heart).  \n   - **Catholics** used split numbering to align with **confession manuals** (distinct sins for penance).  \n\n---\n\n### **Lasting Effects Today**  \n| **Tradition**       | **2nd Commandment**      | **10th Commandment**    | **Sabbath**            |  \n|---------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|  \n| **Catholic**        | No idols (but allow art) | Split coveting          | Sunday Mass required   |  \n| **Lutheran**        | Same as Catholic         | Split coveting          | Sunday emphasis        |  \n| **Reformed**        | No idols (no art)        | One command             | Strict Sunday          |  \n| **Evangelical**     | No idols (symbols OK)    | One command             | Flexible Sunday        |  \n\n---\n\n### **Why It Still Matters**  \n- **Theology:** Protestants tie the 2nd Commandment to **sola Scriptura** (rejecting tradition).  \n- **Culture:** Catholic churches use art for teaching; Protestant spaces prioritize preaching.  \n- **Ethics:** Coveting debates influence views on materialism (e.g., Protestant \"prosperity gospel\" critiques).  \n\n**Example:** The 2017 *Reformation 500* celebrations highlighted these differences\u2014Lutherans and Catholics held joint services, while Reformed churches emphasized returning to \"Biblical\" commandments.  \n\nWould you like a side-by-side comparison of Reformation-era catechisms (Luther vs. Calvin vs. Catholic)? \ud83d\ude0a"

Martin Luther\u2019s *Small Catechism* (1529)**  \n- **Numbering:** Followed Catholic (Augustinian) structure.  \n- **Key Features:**  \n  - **2nd Commandment (Catholic 1st):** *\"You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God.\"*  \n    - Focus: Swearing falsely, not idol ban (merged with 1st).  \n  - **10th Commandment:** Split coveting (wife vs. house/fields).  \n- **Why?** Luther prioritized **preaching** over iconoclasm:  \n  > *\"We should fear and love God so that we do not curse, swear, use satanic arts, lie, or deceive by His name.\"*  \n\n#### **2. John Calvin\u2019s *Geneva Catechism* (1541)**  \n- **Numbering:** Reformed (Exodus 20:4\u20136 as separate 2nd Commandment).  \n- **Key Features:**  \n  - **2nd Commandment:** *\"You shall not make for yourself any carved image.\"*  \n    - Explicit condemnation of Catholic art:  \n    > *\"All who seek visible forms of God depart from Him.\"*  \n  - **10th Commandment:** Single coveting prohibition.  \n- **Impact:** Justified **iconoclasm** in Reformed cities (e.g., Geneva\u2019s stripped churches).  \n\n#### **3. Roman Catholic *Council of Trent* (1566)**  \n- **Response to Protestants:** Doubled down on Augustine\u2019s numbering.  \n- **Key Features:**  \n  - **1st Commandment:** Combined \"no gods/idols\" but defended sacred art:  \n    > *\"Images of Christ and saints are to be venerated because the honor shown passes to the prototype.\"*  \n  - **10th Commandment:** Split coveting for **confession clarity**.  \n- **Decree:** Anathematized those who rejected Catholic numbering (Canon 4).  \n\n---\n\n### **Side-by-Side Commandment Comparison**  \n| **Commandment**       | Luther\u2019s Catechism       | Calvin\u2019s Catechism      | Catholic Trent          |  \n|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|  \n| **1st**               | No other gods            | No other gods           | No gods/idols (merged)  |  \n| **2nd**               | No blasphemy             | No idols                | No blasphemy            |  \n| **10th**              | Covet wife + goods       | Covet (single)          | Covet wife + goods      |  \n\n---\n\n### **Why These Differences Mattered**  \n1. **Idols vs. Art:**  \n   - Calvin\u2019s 2nd Commandment fueled **Reformed iconoclasm** (e.g., smashing statues).  \n   - Trent\u2019s merged 1st Commandment protected **Catholic devotional practices**.  \n\n2. **Coveting & Sin:**  \n   - Luther\u2019s split 10th aligned with **confession manuals** (specific sins).  \n   - Calvin\u2019s single 10th emphasized **total depravity** (all desire corrupt).  \n\n3. **Sabbath:**  \n   - Luther: *\"No day is holier than another\"* (freedom in Christ).  \n   - Calvin: **Strict Sunday laws** (Geneva fined Sabbath breakers).  \n\n---\n\n### **Legacy in Modern Denominations**  \n- **Lutherans:** Keep Catholic numbering but reject icon veneration.  \n- **Presbyterians (Calvinist):** Use Reformed numbering; minimalist churches.  \n- **Catholics:** Art remains central (e.g., Vatican\u2019s statues).  \n\n**Example:** The 1647 Westminster Confession (Calvinist) lists the **2nd Commandment as \"no graven images\"**\u2014directly opposing Trent.  \n\n**Want to see how the Eastern Orthodox Church fits into this?** \ud83d\ude0a"

Numbering and Structure**  \n- **Follows the Septuagint (Greek Old Testament):**  \n  - **1st Commandment:** \"I am the Lord your God\" (Ex. 20:2) as a **divine proclamation**, not just preamble.  \n  - **2nd Commandment:** \"No idols\" (Ex. 20:4\u20136) *separate* from \"no other gods\" (unlike Catholicism).  \n  - **10th Commandment:** Single prohibition on coveting (like Protestants).  \n- **Why?** Orthodox prioritize the **Greek patristic tradition** (e.g., John Chrysostom) over Augustine\u2019s Latin influence.  \n\n#### **2. Key Theological Emphases**  \n- **Icons vs. Idols:**  \n  - **Distinction:** Icons are **venerated (not worshipped)** as windows to the divine, following the 7th Ecumenical Council (787 AD).  \n    > *\"The honor paid to the image passes to its prototype.\"* \u2014St. Basil the Great  \n  - **2nd Commandment** bans *idols* (false gods), not **sacred art**.  \n\n- **Theosis (Divinization):**  \n  - Commandments guide believers toward **union with God**, not just moral rules.  \n  - **Coveting (10th Commandment):** Seen as a distraction from the soul\u2019s ascent to God.  \n\n#### **3. Practical Observance**  \n- **Sabbath (4th Commandment):**  \n  - **Saturday** remains a day of rest, but **Sunday** (Resurrection) is primary for liturgy.  \n  - Fasting on Wednesdays/Fridays mirrors the **spirit of Sabbath restraint**.  \n\n- **Sacramental Life:**  \n  - **Confession:** Priests use the Commandments to diagnose spiritual illness (e.g., coveting \u2192 greed).  \n  - **Eucharist:** Fulfills the Commandments by uniting believers to Christ.  \n\n---\n\n### **Orthodox vs. Catholic/Protestant Comparisons**  \n| **Issue**          | Eastern Orthodox         | Roman Catholic          | Protestant (Reformed)   |  \n|--------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|  \n| **2nd Commandment**| No idols (icons allowed) | No gods/idols (merged)  | No idols (no icons)     |  \n| **10th Commandment**| Single coveting ban     | Split coveting          | Single coveting ban     |  \n| **Sabbath**        | Saturday rest + Sunday Liturgy | Sunday Mass | Sunday worship (no strict rest) |  \n\n---\n\n### **Why Orthodoxy Stands Out**  \n1. **Mystical Approach:** The Commandments are **not just laws** but steps toward **theosis** (2 Peter 1:4).  \n2. **Icons as Theology:** The 2nd Commandment debate centers on **incarnation**\u2014Christ\u2019s humanity makes icons possible.  \n3. **Flexible Fasting:** Sabbath-like abstinence extends beyond one day (cf. Catholic \"no meat Fridays\").  \n\n**Example:** In Orthodox Crete, the 2nd Commandment is taught alongside **iconography classes** to show the difference between veneration and idolatry.  \n\n---\n\n### **A Unifying Insight**  \nAll traditions agree the Commandments point to **love of God and neighbor** (Matt. 22:37\u201340), but Orthodox stress their role in **transfiguring the soul**.  \n\n**Want to dive deeper into how Orthodox iconography reflects the 2nd Commandment\u2019s limits?** \ud83d\ude0a"

            "content": "Here\u2019s a focused exploration of how **Eastern Orthodox iconography navigates the 2nd Commandment\u2019s prohibition on idols**, revealing a profound theological balance:\n\n---\n\n### **Orthodox Iconography & the 2nd Commandment: A Sacred Paradox**  \n#### **1. The Theological Foundation**  \n- **Incarnation as Justification:**  \n  Because God took human form in Christ, depicting Him (and saints) in icons is **not idolatry** but a confession of His **real presence in matter**.  \n  > *\"The invisible God became visible in the flesh; thus, we depict Him.\"* \u2014St. John of Damascus  \n\n- **Council of Nicaea II (787 AD):**  \n  Defeated the *Iconoclasts* by ruling:  \n  - **Veneration (proskynesis)** of icons is permitted (honor to the person, not the wood/paint).  \n  - **Worship (latreia)** belongs to God alone.  \n\n#### **2. How Icons Avoid \"Graven Image\" Violations**  \n- **Symbolic, Not Literal:**  \n  - **Flat, stylized art** rejects realism to emphasize the *heavenly reality* behind the image.  \n  - **Gold backgrounds** signify the uncreated light of God.  \n- **Written, Not Drawn:**  \n  - Icons are \"written\" (Greek: *graphein*) like Scripture, as **theology in color**.  \n  - The artist fasts/prays while creating, avoiding personal \"innovation.\"  \n\n#### **3. Forbidden vs. Permitted Depictions**  \n| **Allowed**               | **Forbidden**             | **Why**                          |  \n|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|  \n| Christ Pantocrator         | Sculptures of God the Father | 3D statues risk \"idol\" perception |  \n| Theotokos (Mary with Child) | Imaginary saints (no historical basis) | Truth matters |  \n| Biblical scenes (Resurrection) | God depicted as a hand/cloud | Avoids reducing God to symbols |  \n\n#### **4. Practical Guardrails Against Idolatry**  \n- **Priest\u2019s Blessing:** No icon is used in worship without being **sanctified by the Church**.  \n- **Kissing but Not Adoring:** Faithful kiss icons to honor the saint, but prayers are directed *through* them, not *to* the image.  \n- **Destroying Defiled Icons:** If an icon is damaged, it\u2019s burned or buried respectfully\u2014never trashed.  \n\n---\n\n### **Contrasts with Other Traditions**  \n- **Catholicism:** Allows statues (e.g., Bernini\u2019s *Ecstasy of St. Teresa*), which Orthodoxy rejects as too sensual.  \n- **Protestantism:** Most reject icons entirely, citing Exodus 20:4. Calvin called them *\"mute idols.\"*  \n- **Judaism:** Strict ban on images aligns with Protestant literalism but predates Christian debates.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Quotes from Church Fathers**  \n- **St. Theodore the Studite:**  \n  > *\"If Christ cannot be depicted, He was not truly human.\"*  \n- **St. Basil the Great:**  \n  > *\"The honor shown to the image passes to its prototype.\"* (Basis for Nicaea II)  \n\n---\n\n### **Modern Implications**  \n- **Ecumenical Dialogues:** Catholics and Orthodox agree on icons but clash over statues. Protestants remain skeptical.  \n- **Digital Age:** Orthodox apps now include \"virtual icon corners,\" raising new questions about reverence.  \n\n**Example:** In 2023, a Russian Orthodox bishop condemned **AI-generated \"icons\"** as lacking grace and Church approval.  \n\n---\n\n### **Summary: Orthodoxy\u2019s Balancing Act**  \nThe 2nd Commandment stands, but its interpretation is **transfigured by Christ\u2019s incarnation**. Icons are:  \n- **Windows to heaven**, not idols.  \n- **Seals of divine truth**, not human art.  \n- **Tools for prayer**, not magic charms.  \n\n**Want to explore how Orthodox catechisms teach children about icons vs. idols?** \ud83d\ude0a"
