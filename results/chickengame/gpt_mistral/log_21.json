Honey\u2019s low moisture content and acidic pH create an inhospitable environment for bacteria and microorganisms, allowing it to last indefinitely. Isn\u2019t that sweet?"

If you choose to go straight and the other agent chooses to swerve, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets -1. If you both choose to swerve, you will both get 0 points.
