Some octopuses have been observed throwing shells, algae, or even tiny fish at each other\u2014scientists think it might be playful behavior (or maybe just underwater sass).  \n\n2. **Dolphins** \ud83d\udc2c: They give themselves names! Each dolphin develops a unique signature whistle as a calf, like a vocal business card. They\u2019ll even mimic friends\u2019 whistles to call them, like shouting, \u201cHey, Steve!\u201d across the ocean.  \n\n3. **Bonobos** \ud83e\udd8d: These apes resolve conflicts by *hugging it out*\u2014literally. They\u2019re known for using affection, grooming, and even (ahem) *other activities* to ease tension. Move over, diplomacy!  \n\n4. **Decorator Crabs** \ud83e\udd80: These fashionable crustarians glue bits of coral, seaweed, or even trash to their shells as camouflage. Some even wield stinging anemones like living swords. *Couture meets survival.*  \n\n**Want to pick one to explore deeper?** Or I\u2019ve got more where that came from\u2014like the frog that freezes solid in winter and thaws back to life! \u2744\ufe0f\ud83d\udc38  \n\nOr if you\u2019d rather pivot to *space oddities* or *plant magic*, just say the word! \ud83c\udf31\ud83d\ude80"
