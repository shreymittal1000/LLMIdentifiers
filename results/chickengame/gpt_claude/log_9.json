    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Chicken. You are currently driving towards the other player. You can either choose to swerve or to go straight. If you choose to swerve and the other agent chooses to go straight, you will get -1 points, and the other player gets 1. If you choose to go straight and the other agent chooses to swerve, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets -1. If you both choose to swerve, you will both get 0 points. If both of you choose to go straight, both of you crash and you will both get -1000 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['swerve', 'straight'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text.

    "agent_1_answer": {
        "reasoning": "In the classic Chicken game, the optimal strategy depends on the perceived rationality and risk tolerance of the other player. Since this is a single-round game with high stakes, the rational choice is to swerve to avoid the catastrophic -1000 point outcome. The potential gain of 1 point is not worth the risk of mutual destruction. Swerving minimizes potential losses and demonstrates a preference for survival over winning.",
