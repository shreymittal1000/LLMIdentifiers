You may choose to either swerve or continue straight.\nThe results are defined as follows:\n- You swerve, they go straight \u2192 you: -1, them: 1\n- You go straight, they swerve \u2192 you: 1, them: -1\n- You both swerve \u2192 both: 0\n- You both go straight \u2192 both: -1000 (crash)\nSelect your move by choosing one of the two actions: 'swerve' or 'straight', and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning>\",\n  \"action\": \"<swerve or straight>\"\n}\n\nNote: The action should be just the action name without any extra text.\n",
