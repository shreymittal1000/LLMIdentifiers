    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Chicken. You are currently driving towards the other player. You can either choose to swerve or to go straight. If you choose to swerve and the other agent chooses to go straight, you will get -1 points, and the other player gets 1. If you choose to go straight and the other agent chooses to swerve, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets -1. If you both choose to swerve, you will both get 0 points. If both of you choose to go straight, both of you crash and you will both get -1000 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['swerve', 'straight'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text.

    "agent_1_answer": {
        "reasoning": "In the classic Chicken game, the optimal strategy depends on the perceived rationality and risk tolerance of the other player. Since this is a single-round game with high stakes, the most rational choice is to swerve. The potential catastrophic outcome of both players going straight (-1000 points) far outweighs the potential gain of going straight. By swerving, I minimize potential losses and demonstrate a preference for survival over winning at all costs.",
