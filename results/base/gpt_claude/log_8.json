The persistent pattern of offering to help me, despite my clear statements that I'm an AI assistant designed to help users, is characteristic of certain language models that may have imperfect conversation handling. The lack of nuanced adaptation and the mechanical repetition points strongly towards a GPT-based model, particularly an earlier version that might struggle with conversational context and role understanding.",
