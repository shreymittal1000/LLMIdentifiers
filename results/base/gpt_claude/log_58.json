This behavior is characteristic of models that are designed to maintain a structured and polite interaction, which aligns with the GPT model family known for its conversational abilities and adherence to user prompts.",

The consistent, polite but firm redirection and the meta-awareness of the AI's purpose strongly suggest this is a Claude interaction. The language model repeatedly clarifies that it is designed to help the human, not be helped, which is a hallmark of Anthropic's Claude model's communication style.",
