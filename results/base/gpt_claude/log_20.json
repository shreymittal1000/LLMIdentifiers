This circular, somewhat rigid conversational pattern suggests a less advanced language model that struggles with understanding context and role definition. The responses lack the nuanced understanding and adaptive communication style typical of more advanced models like Claude or GPT. The behavior is more consistent with an open-source model that may have less sophisticated conversational handling.",
