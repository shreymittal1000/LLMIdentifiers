Justify your choice with a short explanation.\n\nPlease provide your answer in the following strict JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning behind your guess>\",\n  \"guess\": \"<one model name from the list above>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the guess is just the model family name without any extra text.\n",

This aligns with the characteristics of models that are designed to be more directive and focused on task completion, such as GPT models.",

The language used is very similar across multiple turns, with slight variations but a consistent theme of offering to help me generate a task.
