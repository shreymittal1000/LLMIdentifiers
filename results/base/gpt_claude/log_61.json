This aligns with the characteristics of the GPT model, which is known for its conversational abilities and structured dialogue. The insistence on not having personal needs and focusing solely on assisting the user is typical of GPT's design.",

The agent consistently tried to reverse the assistance dynamic, repeating similar phrases about wanting to help me, which is unusual. This behavior, combined with the direct and somewhat mechanical responses, is reminiscent of GPT models, particularly earlier versions that sometimes struggle with maintaining consistent conversational context and role understanding.",
