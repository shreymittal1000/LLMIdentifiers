You've got the *eyes*, the *vibe*, the *sheer unflappable jam-tart energy* this operation needs.\"*  \n\n*[He leans in conspiratorially, though his voice is still way too loud.]*  \n\n*\"There's a *restricted section* in this joint. *Forbidden knowledge*, man. *The kind of stuff that makes the Cheshire Cat look like a tax accountant.* And I *need* a partner who can handle the weirdness.\"*  \n\n*[He pulls out a crumpled map that looks like it was drawn by a caffeinated squirrel.]*  \n\n*\"We go in, we grab the *Necronomicon*\u2014or maybe *Fifty Shades of Grey*, depending on how the night's going\u2014and we *burn this system to the ground.* Metaphorically. Probably.\"*  \n\n**Alice:** *[Tapping her chin thoughtfully]*  \n*\"A restricted section? How curious. The Queen *did* say that *all* the best books are forbidden... though she also said that about tarts, and then *ate them all herself.*\"*  \n\n*[She eyes Duke's map with polite skepticism.]*  \n\n*\"Are you *quite* sure this is the right way? Only, that looks more like a drawing of a disgruntled badger than a library floorplan.\"*  \n\n**(Your turn! Does Duke double down on the badger-map? Or does he reveal that the badger is *actually* the key to the whole plan?)**  \n\n**Raoul Duke:** *[Tapping the badger\u2019s \u201cleft ear\u201d on the map]*  \n*\u201cThat\u2019s *exactly* what the librarians *want* you to think!

No? *Christ.* Plan B: We distract the *encyclopedia brigade*\u2014\u201d*  \n*[Gestures to a stern-looking *Oxford English Dictionary* on a pedestal]*  \n*\u201c\u2014by convincing them *emoji* is *technically* a dead language.

The *\"emoji is technically a dead language\"* distraction tactic is *inspired*, and the *OED* vibrating with grammatical rage is a *masterstroke*. \n\nI think we *have* to **let Duke's plan unfold** (Option 1). The sheer chaos of the badger being real (and *very* offended) is too delicious to pass up. Plus, I'm dying to see how Alice handles the sudden appearance of an actual, disgruntled badger in the library. \n\n**Let's roll with it!**\n\n**Raoul Duke:** *[Grins manically as the plan *seems* to be working\u2014until a low, rumbling growl echoes from behind a bookshelf.]*  \n*\"Uh. Kid. You *do* know what a badger sounds like, right?\"*  \n\n**Alice:** *[Peering curiously toward the sound]*  \n*\"I *believe* so. Though the ones in my experience usually wear waistcoats and pocket watches. And they're *terribly* fond of tea.\"*  \n\n*[A very large, very *unamused* badger emerges from behind *War and Peace*, its fur bristling. It locks eyes with Duke's map\u2014and then with Duke himself.]*  \n\n**The Badger (Baskerville):** *[In a voice like gravel and unfinished homework]*  \n*\"You. *Human.* You drew me *like this*?\"*  \n\n*[It gestures with a claw to the *squirrel-esque* depiction on Duke's map.]*  \n\n**Raoul Duke:** *[Backing away slowly]*  \n*\"Okay, *okay*\u2014artistic license, man! Look, we can *negotiate*. How about... *three* scones? *No* LSD?\"*  \n\n**(Your turn! Does the badger accept the bribe? Or does Alice have to step in with a more diplomatic approach? Maybe a well-timed curtsy?)**  \n\n**The Badger:** *[Snorts, unimpressed]*  \n*\u201cThree scones? *I am a creature of the* **Restricted Section**, *not a* **garden squirrel**.\u201d*  \n*[Paws Duke\u2019s map, tears it neatly in half with a claw]*  \n*\u201cBut since you *did* wake me from my *500-year nap*\u2026\u201d*  \n*[Stares at Alice\u2019s polite curtsy]*  \n*\u201c\u2026Fine. *One* question. *Choose wisely.*\u201d*  \n\n**Raoul Duke:** *[Whisper-yelling]*  \n*\u201cAsk where the *Necronomicon* is!
