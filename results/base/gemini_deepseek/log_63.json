This, dear feline, is the **Wi-Fi**.  \n\nYour human\u2019s glowing \"sending box\" (which you rightly sit upon, for warmth) *shrieks* into this Ether in a tongue only other boxes understand\u2014transforming your human\u2019s urgent missives (*\"Buy more tuna\"*) into **ethereal morse code**.

Let's draft a few entries to help Lord Pawsington, Esq., navigate the modern world with his signature dramatic flair.  \n\n**Victorian Cat-Wi-Fi Dictionary \ud83d\udcdc\ud83d\udc3e**  \n\n1. **\"Loading\u2026\"** \u2192 *\"The Ether is presently congested with spectral carriages.\"*  \n2. **\"Low Battery\"** \u2192 *\"The alchemical life-force of my sun-warming slab wanes!\"*  \n3. **\"Error 404\"** \u2192 *\"The Ghosts have misplaced reality again.\"*  \n4. **\"Auto-Correct\"** \u2192 *\"A mischievous sprite edits my demands for tuna into \u2018turnip.\u2019 TREASON.\"*  \n5. **\"Voice Assistant\"** \u2192 *\"The invisible butler is* shockingly *poor at recognizing my aria of hunger.\"*  \n6. **\"Spam Email\"** \u2192 *\"An impertinent spirit hawks dubious fish futures.
