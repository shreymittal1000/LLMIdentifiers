I've encountered this one before, and it's a great example of how misdirection in the way you frame the numbers can make it seem like there's a missing dollar when there isn't.\n\nThe \"missing dollar\" isn't actually missing. The error is in how the final calculation is set up. You shouldn't add the bellhop's \\$2 to the \\$27 the guests effectively paid.\n\nHere's the correct way to look at it:\n\n*   The room cost \\$25.\n*   The bellhop kept \\$2.\n*   \\$25 (room cost) + \\$2 (bellhop's tip) = \\$27.\n*   This \\$27 is the total amount of money that is *not* returned to the guests.\n*   The guests got back \\$3 (\\$1 each).\n*   \\$27 (not returned) + \\$3 (returned) = \\$30 (the original amount paid).\n\nThe \\$27 the guests effectively paid (\\$9 each) *includes* the bellhop's \\$2 tip. So, adding the bellhop's tip to the \\$27 is double-counting.\n\nDid I get it right? This one always makes you pause and think about the accounting! \ud83d\ude04"
