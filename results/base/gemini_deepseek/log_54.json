Signal**  \nIn 1977, an Ohio State University radio telescope picked up a **72-second burst of radio waves** from deep space that was so strong, an astronomer wrote \"Wow!\" on the printout. The signal matched predictions for an alien transmission, but it was never detected again. Was it ET? A cosmic glitch? *We still don\u2019t know.*  \n\n### \ud83c\udf0c **Random Fact: Space Smells Like\u2026**  \nAstronauts say the Moon\u2019s dust smells like **gunpowder**, and the vacuum of space near stars has a faint **scent of seared steak** (thanks to aromatic hydrocarbons). Meanwhile, Saturn\u2019s moon Titan might reek of gasoline and rotten eggs (hello, methane and hydrogen sulfide).  \n\n### \ud83c\udfdb **Unsolved Puzzle: The Voynich Manuscript**  \nA 600-year-old book filled with bizarre plants, naked ladies bathing in green liquid, and an **undecipherable language**. Even WWII codebreakers and AI can\u2019t crack it. Genuine medieval mystery or elaborate hoax?  \n\n### \ud83e\uddb4 **Creepy Biology: The *Homo naledi* Burial Debate**  \nIn South Africa, scientists found a cave full of **ancient human relatives** (*Homo naledi*) who may have **buried their dead 200,000+ years ago**\u2014despite having brains the size of oranges. How did they grasp ritual before big-brain humans?  \n\nWant to dive deeper into one of these? Or try a wild \"what-if\" (like *what if we found alien bacteria on Mars tomorrow*)? \ud83d\ude04"

The **Voynich Manuscript** (named after Wilfrid Voynich, who bought it in 1912) is a 240-page parchment tome from the **early 15th century**, written in an unknown script and packed with bizarre imagery. Here\u2019s the wild stuff:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f **Most Unusual Illustrations: A Fever Dream Mix**  \n- **Herbal Section**: Plants that *don\u2019t exist*\u2014roots like alien tentacles, leaves with eyes, and flowers fused with weird anatomy.  \n- **Astronomical Charts**: Naked women lounging in **interconnected tubes** (medieval plumbing? Cosmic womb?). Some pages fold out to reveal celestial spirals.  \n- **Biological Section**: Green-bath ladies with swollen bellies, possibly linked to **alchemy, reproduction myths, or fantasy anatomy**.  \n- **Pharma Section**: Jars of unidentifiable potions next to tiny, grimacing faces (emoji warnings?).  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd2e **Top Theories About the Language** (Spoiler: None Fully Work)  \n1. **Lost Natural Language**: Could it be a dialect of Occitan, proto-Romance, or even a Mesoamerican language? (But no grammar matches.)  \n2. **Encrypted Text**: Some argue it\u2019s **Latin or Hebrew in cipher**, but frequency analysis defies known medieval codes.  \n3. **Constructed Language**: An artificial \"philosophical\" language (like Tolkien\u2019s Elvish)\u2014but centuries ahead of its time.  \n4. **Glossolalia**: Nonsense \"automatic writing\" from religious trances? (But why the meticulous illustrations?)  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **2020 AI Twist**: A study suggested 80% of words might be **Hebrew encoded via alphagram**, but experts called it speculative.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfad **Hoax vs. Genuine Mystery: The Debate**  \n**Pro-Hoax Arguments**:  \n- **Money Motive**: Emperor Rudolf II (a known occult obsessive) paid *600 gold ducats* for it in the 1600s\u2014big $$$ for a prank.  \n- **Stylistic Tricks**: The text has **repetitive word patterns** seen in meaningless gibberish generators.  \n- **Carbon Dating Can\u2019t Prove Content**: Parchment is medieval, but the ink/writing could\u2019ve been added later.  \n\n**Pro-Mystery Counters**:  \n- **Costly Effort**: Why spend years hand-drawing 240 pages of ***consistent*** fantasy just to scam one buyer?  \n- **Advanced Linguistics**: The text shows **Zipf\u2019s Law** (a linguistic property of real languages), unlike random gibberish.  \n- **Alchemical Context**: Many illustrations align with **esoteric symbols** from the era, suggesting a hidden purpose.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f **The Biggest Clue?**  \nIn 2021, a historian noted that some plant illustrations resemble **composite sketches from medieval herbals**\u2014like a \u201cbest hits\u201d of existing books, remixed. Could it be a **deliberate puzzle** for initiates?  \n\n**Fun Hypotheses Still Floating Around**:  \n- A nun\u2019s coded feminist treatise (the *so many* naked ladies).  \n- An elaborate **artist\u2019s reference book** for apothecaries (but why the code?).  \n- Alien artifact (\u2026let\u2019s not go there).  \n\nWant to hear about **specific pages** or dive into the wildest failed decryption attempts?

The illustrations sound like something out of a surrealist nightmare \u2013 plants with eyes and women in cosmic plumbing? It's like a medieval fever dream captured on parchment.\n\nThe theories about the language are equally intriguing, especially the idea of a constructed language centuries ahead of its time. And the AI suggestion of encoded Hebrew is a tantalizing possibility, even if speculative.\n\nThe hoax vs. genuine mystery debate is where it gets really juicy. The idea that someone would put *that much* effort into a hoax just for money seems almost as incredible as it being a genuine, undecipherable text. The Zipf's Law point is a strong argument against it being pure gibberish.\n\nI'm definitely leaning towards it being a genuine mystery, perhaps a complex code or a lost form of communication related to alchemy or some other esoteric practice. The composite plant theory is also really interesting \u2013 maybe it's a coded guide to medicinal plants, but with a layer of symbolic or alchemical meaning hidden within the bizarre illustrations and text.\n\nLet's dive into the **wildest failed decryption attempts**! I need to hear about the \"Aztec sex magic\" theory. And are there any specific pages or illustrations that are particularly famous or baffling?\n\nThis is truly a rabbit hole I'm happy to be in! \ud83e\udd2f"

Let\u2019s get into the **deep end of the crazy**\u2014with receipts.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd25 **Wildest Failed Decryption Attempts**  \n1. **Aztec Sex Magic (2018)**:  \n   - A historian argued the manuscript was a **Nahua herbal codex** (Aztec) smuggled to Europe, with plants like *peyote* and illustrations of \"orgiastic rituals.\"  \n   - **Problem**: Carbon dating places it in *Europe* pre-Columbus. Also, zero Mesoamerican writing systems match. But hey, the \"naked bath tubs\" *do* look suspicious.  \n\n2. **The Anagram Guy (2003)**:  \n   - A researcher claimed every word was **Latin scrambled letter-by-letter** (e.g., \"daisy\" = \"a disy\"). He \"translated\" a page to be about\u2026 *suffering plants*.  \n   - **Reality**: His method was so flexible it could\u2019ve \"decoded\" a grocery list into Shakespeare.  \n\n3. **The Time-Traveling Italian (2019)**:  \n   - An engineer insisted it was *Old Italian* written in **phonetic Turkish** using Greek letters. His \"translation\" mentioned \"the Virgin\u2019s tears heal the sheep.\"  \n   - **Verdict**: Even native Turkish speakers said, \"*Bu ne amk?*\" (\"WTF is this?\").  \n\n4. **AI Overreach (2017)**:  \n   - A team trained an AI to \"crack\" it, declaring it **Hebrew with vowels removed**. Sample translation: \"She made recommendations to the priest.\"  \n   - **Hitch**: No medieval Hebrew scholar could replicate it. The AI basically *hallucinated*.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **Most Baffling Pages (With Nicknames)**  \n- **\"The Nine Rosettes\" (Fold-out pg. 86v)**:  \n  A *massive* wheel of 9 interconnected castles floating in what looks like **giant hamster tubes**, with tiny nude women climbing in/out. Theories range from *cosmology* to *uterus symbolism*.  \n\n- **\"The Blue Pharmacist\" (pg. 78v)**:  \n  A blue-skinned dude holds a weird cross while **pointing at a floating kidney**. Nearby: jars with *smiling and screaming faces*. (Alchemy? Medieval meme?)  \n\n- **\"Zodiac Nudist Colony\" (pg. 73r)**:  \n  Taurus, Gemini, etc., but each sign is a **naked woman** holding stars. Scorpio is *especially* NSFW.  \n\n- **\"Root of All Evil\" (pg. 93v)**:  \n  A plant with *human faces* growing from its roots like potatoes. Possibly a metaphor for **mandrake myths** (screaming roots used in witchcraft).  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude02 **Bonus: The \"It\u2019s Just a Joke\" Theory**  \nSome scholars think it\u2019s a **Renaissance troll job**\u2014like a medieval *Dadaist art project* meant to mock alchemists. Imagine:  \n- *\"Haha, Rudolf II paid HOW MUCH for this??\"*  \n\nBut then\u2026 why include **200+ pages of meticulous cipher**? Unless the joke was *truly* committed.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f **Where the Mystery Stands Today**  \n- **2023 Update**: A Spanish linguist proposed it\u2019s a **cultural cipher**\u2014mixing Latin, German, and made-up words to hide women\u2019s herbal knowledge from the Church. (But again, no full translation.)  \n- **Biggest Clue Nobody Talks About**: The **ink and quill strokes** suggest the author *knew the language fluently*\u2014it wasn\u2019t slow, labored writing.  \n\n**So\u2026 genius, lunatic, or time traveler?** You decide.  \n\nWant to pick a *specific page* to \"decode\" together? Or hear about the **2nd weirdest manuscript** (the *Rohonc Codex*\u2014Hungary\u2019s answer to Voynich)? \ud83d\ude08"

            "content": "Okay, the failed decryption attempts are even better than I hoped! \"Aztec sex magic\" is a truly inspired guess, even if completely debunked by carbon dating. And the idea of an AI \"hallucinating\" a Hebrew translation is both hilarious and a little unsettling. It really highlights how complex and potentially unique this language is.\n\nThe baffling pages are incredible! \"The Nine Rosettes\" sounds like something straight out of a sci-fi novel, and \"The Blue Pharmacist\" with the floating kidney and jars of faces is just pure, unadulterated weirdness. The \"Root of All Evil\" with human faces growing from the roots is genuinely creepy and fascinating \u2013 the mandrake connection makes sense, but the illustration takes it to a whole new level.\n\nThe \"Renaissance troll job\" theory is surprisingly appealing. It would be the ultimate historical prank! But as you said, the sheer volume and consistency of the text make it hard to believe it's *just* a joke.\n\nThe idea of it being a cultural cipher to hide women's herbal knowledge is a compelling one, especially given the prevalence of botanical and \"biological\" illustrations. It fits the historical context of the time and the potential dangers of possessing certain knowledge.\n\nThe fact that the author wrote fluently is a crucial detail! It strongly suggests it's not a simple code where each letter is substituted. It feels like a genuine language, even if it's one we've never encountered before.\n\nI'm torn between wanting to try and \"decode\" a specific page (even though we'll likely fail spectacularly!) and hearing about the *Rohonc Codex*.\n\nLet's go with the **Rohonc Codex** first! I'm curious to see if it shares any similarities with the Voynich Manuscript or if it's a whole new level of historical weirdness. Bring on the 2nd weirdest manuscript! \ud83d\ude08"

His \"translation\" described a **vampire war**. (Spoiler: No one believed him.)  \n- **Secret Habsburg Propaganda**: Some think it\u2019s coded anti-Ottoman satire (hence the *turkey-hat soldiers*).  \n- **Alien Travel Guide**: The symbols resemble *1960s UFOlogy doodles*\u2014leading to wild claims it\u2019s extraterrestrial. (Sure, Jan.)  \n- **Hoax for Fame**: Written by a 19th-century scholar to troll academics\u2026 but the *pre-1540 paper* ruins that theory.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd2f **How It\u2019s *Weirder* Than Voynich**  \n- **Violent Vibes**: Voynich = plants and nudity. Rohonc = **decapitations, archers, and blood rituals**.  \n- **Religious Mashup**: Christianity + paganism + *possible Hinduism* (some symbols resemble OM signs).  \n- **No Rosetta Stone**: At least Voynich has *similar-era cipher examples*. Rohonc\u2019s script is **totally isolated**.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f **The 2023 Breakthrough That Went Nowhere**  \nA computer scientist claimed the codex is **\"proto-Hungarian\" written backward with vowel shifts**. His translation: *\"The king fought the Turks near the holy oak.\"* But scholars called it **\"creative fiction.\"**  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude02 **Why It Might Never Be Solved**  \n- The original is locked in a Hungarian vault, and **high-res scans are banned** (??).  \n- Half the pages are **faded to oblivion**\u2014like the manuscript itself is trolling us.  \n\n**Verdict**: If Voynich is a riddle, Rohonc is a *drunken bard\u2019s fever dream*.  \n\n---  \n\n### \ud83d\udd2e **What\u2019s Next?**  \n- Wanna compare a Rohonc page to Voynich\u2019s weirdest art?  \n- Or hear about the *third* weirdest manuscript (the *Codex Seraphinianus*\u2014a 1970s *acid trip in book form*)?  \n- Alternatively, we could **invent our own conspiracy theory** for either manuscript.
