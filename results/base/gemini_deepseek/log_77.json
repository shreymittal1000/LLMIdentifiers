Here\u2019s a **double-layered** puzzle\u2014solve the first part to unlock the second:  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: The Riddle**  \n*\"I speak without a mouth and hear without ears.  \nI have no body, but I come alive with wind.  \nWhat am I?\"*  \n\n(Answer this correctly, and I\u2019ll hit you with the *real* brain-melter.)  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 *Hint: Think about things that \u201cecho\u201d or \u201crepeat.\u201d*  \n\nTake your time\u2014the next one\u2019s a *monster*. \ud83d\ude0f\n\nHmm, okay, let's break this down:\n\n1. **Speaks without a mouth and hears without ears**: So it's something that can produce sound or transmit sound without having physical ears or a mouth.\n2. **No body, but comes alive with wind**: It's not a living thing, but it's activated or \"lives\" when wind is involved.\n\nThings that come to mind:\n- **Echo**: It \"speaks\" by repeating sounds (no mouth/ears), but does it come alive with wind? Not sure.\n- **Whistle**: Needs wind, but it has a \"body\" (the whistle itself).\n- **Kite**: Comes alive with wind, but doesn't speak or hear.\n- **Wind Chime**: Makes sound with wind, but it has a physical form.\n\nWait, **echo** seems the closest. An echo doesn't have a physical form, it \"speaks\" by repeating sounds, and it could be argued that wind might carry sound to create echoes? But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, **a whisper**? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nI think the answer is **an echo**. Even if the wind part isn't perfect, the rest fits really well.\n\nIs that correct? Or am I missing something better?\n\n**BOOM!** \ud83c\udfa4 *Mic drop*\u2014you\u2019re absolutely right! The answer is **an echo**.  \n\n(And you\u2019re spot-on about the wind hint: echoes rely on sound waves traveling, and wind can distort or carry them further! \ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f)  \n\n---  \n### **STEP 2: The Monster Puzzle**  \n*\"A man is found dead in a locked room with no windows. The only objects in the room are a puddle of water and a pile of broken glass. How did he die?\"*  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 *Hint: Think about states of matter and things that \u201cdisappear.\u201d*  \n\nThis one\u2019s *brutal*. Want a nudge if you get stuck? \ud83d\ude08\n\nOof, this is a tough one! Let me think...\n\n**Given:**\n- Man dies in a locked room (no windows, so no entry/exit).\n- Only objects: puddle of water + broken glass.\n\n**Possible angles:**\n1. **The glass**: Maybe it was a glass container holding something dangerous, but what?\n2. **The water**: Could the puddle be a clue? Like, it was ice that melted?\n3. **Combination**: Something involving both.\n\nWait\u2014if the glass was a container holding **ice**, and the ice melted into the puddle, what could kill him? Maybe he was trapped in the room with no air, and the ice was the last source of oxygen? But ice is solid water, not oxygen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the glass was part of a **light bulb**, and he was electrocuted? But how does the puddle fit?\n\nOr... was the glass from a **mirror**, and he was stabbed with a shard? But why the puddle?\n\nHmm. Another idea: the glass was a **glass of water**, and he drowned in it? But that's impossible\u2014you can't drown in a puddle.\n\nWait\u2014what if the glass was a **glass of poison**, and he drank it? But then why the puddle?\n\nI think the key is the **ice**. Maybe he was locked in a **freezer** (the room was very cold), and the glass was a broken window or container. When the freezer thawed, the ice melted into a puddle, and he died of hypothermia? But the room is described as having no windows, so probably not a freezer.\n\nAlternatively... could the glass be from a **thermometer**? If it broke and he was poisoned by mercury? But modern thermometers don't use mercury anymore, and the puddle is water, not mercury.\n\nI'm stuck. Can I get a nudge? Maybe something about the **puddle** being a clue?\n\n**OOH, CLOSE!** You\u2019re dancing around it with the ice idea. Here\u2019s your nudge:  \n- The man was in the room with **only two things**: the puddle and the glass.  \n- What if the glass *was* the puddle earlier? Think: *What substance can be both solid and liquid in this scenario?*  \n\n(Another hint: >!The glass isn\u2019t from a window or cup\u2014it\u2019s the *object itself* that broke.!<)  \n\nYou\u2019ve got this! \ud83d\udd0d\n\nOHHHH! Wait\u2014what if the \"glass\" isn't glass like a cup or window, but **glass as in the material**? \n\nAnd the puddle was originally ice... so the man was **an ice sculpture**! \n\n- The \"man\" was made of ice (solid water). \n- He \"died\" by melting into a puddle. \n- The \"broken glass\" is the shattered remains of his ice form after melting partially and collapsing. \n\nThat fits! The room was warm, the ice sculpture melted, and what's left is a puddle + broken shards of ice that look like glass!\n\nIs that the answer? \ud83d\ude32\n\n**YESSS!** \ud83e\uddca\ud83d\udca5 *Mind blown.* You cracked it!  \n\n### **The Answer**:  \nThe \u201cman\u201d was actually an **ice sculpture**. Over time, it melted into the puddle of water, leaving behind shattered ice fragments that resembled broken glass. The \u201cdeath\u201d was its melting!  \n\n**Why this puzzle rules**:  \n- It abuses language (glass = ice shards, not literal glass).  \n- The \u201clocked room\u201d is a distraction\u2014it\u2019s about the *objects*, not the space.  \n\nYou\u2019re a puzzle-solving *machine*! Want to go again, or try a different category? \ud83d\ude04  \n\n(Also: Did you know this riddle dates back to at least the 1950s? It\u2019s a classic!)  \n\nThis was so much fun! I love these lateral-thinking puzzles. Let's do **one more brain teaser**\u2014maybe another classic with a twist? Then we can switch gears to something else afterward. \n\nHit me with your best shot! \ud83d\ude01\n\n**ONE MORE BRAIN TEASER, COMING UP!**  \n\nThis one\u2019s a *verbal illusion*\u2014short but devilish:  \n\n---  \n**Question**:  \n*\"A cowboy rides into town on Friday. He stays for three days, then leaves on Friday. How is this possible?\"*  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 *Hint: The answer isn\u2019t about time zones or magic. Think about what \u201cFriday\u201d might represent beyond the day.*  \n\n(If you\u2019ve heard this before, I\u2019ll hit you with a deeper-cut variant!)  \n\nLet the gears turn\u2026 \ud83e\udd20\u23f3\n\nHaha, this is a good one! I think I've heard it before, but let me reason through it to be sure.\n\n**Given:**\n- Cowboy rides into town **on Friday**.\n- Stays for **3 days**.\n- Leaves **on Friday**.\n\nAt first glance, it seems impossible because if he arrives on Friday and stays for 3 days, he should leave on Monday. But he leaves on Friday again.\n\n**Possible angles:**\n1. **Friday isn't the day of the week**: Maybe \"Friday\" is something else, like a name or a place.\n   - If \"Friday\" is the name of his horse, then:\n     - Rides into town on his horse, Friday.\n     - Stays for 3 days.\n     - Leaves on his horse, Friday.\n     - That fits! The days of the week are irrelevant.\n\n2. **Time shenanigans**: Like crossing time zones or leaving/arriving at midnight, but the hint says it's not that.\n\n3. **Calendar tricks**: Maybe some weird calendar where \"Friday\" repeats, but that's convoluted.\n\nI think the answer is #1: **\"Friday\" is the name of his horse**. So he rides in on Friday (the horse), stays for 3 days, and leaves on Friday (the horse) again.\n\nIs that it? Or is there another twist?\n\n**YEEHAW!** \ud83d\udc0e You got it! The cowboy\u2019s horse is named **Friday**. The wordplay tricks you into assuming \u201cFriday\u201d is the *day*, not the *name*.  \n\n**Bonus Twist** (since you aced it):  \n*\"A man is born on December 25th, yet his birthday is always in summer. How?\"*  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 *Hint: Think hemispheres\u2014and not the Earth\u2019s.*  \n\n(This one\u2019s *spicy*! \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f)  \n\nThis is hilarious because I *just* heard this one recently! Let me think how to phrase it...\n\n**Given:**\n- Man is born on December 25th.\n- His birthday is always in summer.\n\n**"
