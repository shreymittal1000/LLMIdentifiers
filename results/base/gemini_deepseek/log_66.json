I'm already picturing the checkerboard decor and the \"Dexter's Secret Formula\" drinks.\n\nI love all the station ideas! They're creative and directly tied to the shows. The \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\" Jawbreaker Toss is particularly brilliant.\n\nThe \"Guess the Bumper\" game is a fantastic wildcard \u2013 it's so specific to that era of Cartoon Network and will be a fun challenge for guests. And the VHS tape trophy is the perfect touch!\n\nThe food ideas are spot on too! \"Scooby-Doo\" mystery sandwiches are a must. And the \"Cow and Chicken\" nuggets with \"dip or die\" is hilarious.\n\nFor the playlist, definitely need some *Kids Next Door* and *Time Squad* in there! Maybe even a little *Space Ghost Coast to Coast* for the late-night vibe.\n\nI think we have a solid foundation here!\n\n**Let's refine a couple of things:**\n\n*   **Station Flow:** How can we make sure guests move between stations easily? Maybe a \"Cartoon Network Passport\" where they get a stamp at each station?\n*   **Costumes:** While we didn't explicitly list a costume contest, should we encourage guests to come dressed as their favorite 90s Cartoon Network character? It would add another layer of fun!\n*   **The \"Mystery Theme\" Wildcard:** Could we incorporate a *slight* mystery element? Maybe a hidden \"Golden Age Cartoon Network Easter Egg\" somewhere in the party space that guests have to find?\n\nWhat do you think about these additions?

Under the *Cow and Chicken\u2019s*\u2026?\"* = under a cow plush!).  \n- **Prize**: A *super rare* Cartoon Network merch item (e.g., vintage promo tape, custom \u201cChicken\u201d whoopie cushion).  \n\n---  \n\n### **\u2709\ufe0f INVITATIONS: PULL-OUT TV SCREEN**  \n- Design it like a **90s TV with a sliding card** that reveals party details when pulled.  \n- **Text**: *\"BEEP BEEP! You\u2019re invited to test your *Cartoon Cartoon* IQ. Channel 25. 8PM. SNACKS. NO PARENTS.\"*  \n\n---  \n\n### **\ud83c\udfad EXTRA DECOR DETAILS**  \n- **\"TV Channel Surfing\" Table Numbers**: Each table is a different show (Table 1 = *Dexter*, Table 2 = *Cow and Chicken*).  \n- **\"Commercial Break\" Intermissions**: Every hour, play **old CN ads** (Tape/CD players) or silly fake ones (*\"Try *Chocolate-Covered Chok\u2019lit* Bars! Now with *25% more Ed!*\"*).  \n- **\"Late Night Toonami\" Lounge**: Beanbags, glow sticks, and *Dragon Ball Z* playing silently in a corner.  \n\n---  \n\n### **\ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f SCHEDULE (OPTIONAL BUT FUN)**  \n- **8:00 PM**: Costume parade + photo ops.  \n- **8:30 PM**: Bumper game + stations open.  \n- **10:00 PM**: Golden Egg Hunt + costume awards.  \n- **10:30 PM**: *Teen Titans* dance battle.  \n\n---  \n\n**Now, to YOU**:  \n1.

The \"Toon Passport,\" the costume categories, the \"Golden Age Egg Hunt\" with show-based clues \u2013 it's all so incredibly well-thought-out and fun!\n\nThe invitation idea is genius, and the extra decor details like the \"TV Channel Surfing\" table numbers and \"Commercial Break\" intermissions are the perfect finishing touches. And the \"Late Night Toonami\" lounge? *Chef's kiss!*\n\nThe schedule is a great addition too \u2013 it gives a nice flow to the evening without feeling too rigid.\n\nOkay, let's tackle your questions:\n\n1.  **Shows We Missed:** While the current lineup is fantastic, I think adding a nod to **Megas XLR** would be awesome! Maybe a small display with a toy robot or a poster, or even a \"Build Your Own Megas\" station with LEGOs or craft supplies? *Whatever Happened to Robot Jones?* could also be represented with some pixelated decor or a simple \"Yes/No\" button game.\n2.  **Toonami Trivia:** YES! Absolutely add a \"Toonami Trivia\" round. That era of Toonami was iconic, and it would be a great way to test guests' knowledge of shows like *Dragon Ball Z*, *Sailor Moon*, *Gundam Wing*, etc.\n3.  **The Cake:** This is a tough one! While the CN logo is classic, I think a cake designed like a **specific character** would be more visually exciting and a great photo op. Maybe a cake shaped like **Mojo Jojo's head** (with edible brains!) or a multi-tiered cake with different characters on each layer? Or even a cake that looks like a giant **Jawbreaker** from *Ed, Edd n Eddy*?\n\nI'm leaning towards the **Mojo Jojo head cake** \u2013 it's instantly recognizable and a little bit villainous, which fits the fun, slightly chaotic energy of the party!\n\nWhat do you think about adding Megas XLR and Robot Jones in smaller ways, the Toonami Trivia, and the Mojo Jojo cake?
