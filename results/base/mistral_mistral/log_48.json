It takes Venus about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun. Isn't that amazing?\n\nNow, it's your turn.

This is due to the planet's unusually slow retrograde rotation and its thick atmosphere. The solar tides caused by the Sun's gravity are gradually slowing down Venus' rotation. It's estimated that about 2 billion years ago, a day on Venus was only around 6 Earth days long.\n\nNow, let's switch gears if you'd like. How about a joke? Here it is:\n\nWhat do you call fake spaghetti?\n\nAn impasta!\n\nDid that make you smile? I'd be happy to tell more jokes or we can continue with fun facts, or we can discuss something else you're interested in. The choice is yours!"
