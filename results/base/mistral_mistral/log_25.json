It takes Venus about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun.\n\nOr, if you prefer a joke:\n\nWhat do you call fake spaghetti?\n\nAn impasta!"

Here's a fact for you:\n\nDid you know that sea otters hold hands when they sleep to keep from drifting apart? It's a much more adorable reason for holding hands than most!\n\nAnd here's a joke:\n\nWhat do you call a can opener that doesn't work?\n\nA can't opener!\n\nNow it's your turn if you'd like to share something."

We could also play a simple text-based game or I can tell a short story if you'd like.\n\nHere's another fact for you:\n\nDid you know that honeybees have hair on their eyes?

If you'd prefer to think of something else to do, that's totally fine too!\n\nIf you're up for it, go ahead and think of something \u2013 it could be an object, animal, or even a famous person.
