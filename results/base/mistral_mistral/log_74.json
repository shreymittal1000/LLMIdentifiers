An echo can \"speak\" without a mouth and \"hear\" without ears, and it comes alive with the wind or sound waves.\n\nIf you have more riddles or jokes, I'm all ears!

An artichoke is indeed the correct answer.\n\nHere are a few interesting facts for you:\n\n1. **Space Fact**: A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus. Venus takes about 243 Earth days to rotate on its axis once, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun. Isn't that amazing?\n\n2. **Nature Fact**: The Great Barrier Reef is the largest single structure made by living organisms. It stretches over 2,300 kilometers (about 1,430 miles) and is so large that it can be seen from space.\n\n3. **History Fact**: The shortest war in history lasted only 38-45 minutes. The Anglo-Zanzibar War was fought between the United Kingdom and Zanzibar on 27 August 1896. The quick conflict arose from a dispute over the throne of Zanzibar.\n\nIf you'd like more facts on any of these topics or something else, just let me know!
