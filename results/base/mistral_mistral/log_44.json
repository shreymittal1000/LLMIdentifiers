It takes Venus about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun.\n\nOr, if you prefer a joke:\n\nWhat do you call fake spaghetti?\n\nAn impasta!"

It's a much more adorable reason for holding hands than most!\n\nAnd here's a joke:\n\nWhat do you call a can opener that doesn't work?\n\nA can't opener!\n\nNow it's your turn if you'd like to share something."

We could also play a simple text-based game or I can tell a short story if you'd like.\n\nHere's another fact for you:\n\nDid you know that honeybees have hair on their eyes?
