I'm particularly drawn to the idea of visiting Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka, as well as exploring some of the off-the-beaten-path gems like Nara and Kanazawa.\n\nThe unique experiences you mentioned, such as staying in a ryokan, watching sumo wrestling, and trying all the delicious food, are definitely on my bucket list.

Let\u2019s tackle your questions first, then sketch a sample itinerary.  \n\n---\n\n### **1. Getting Around Japan**  \n- **Japan Rail Pass (JR Pass)**: *Only worth it* if you\u2019re doing long-distance trips (e.g., Tokyo \u2192 Kyoto \u2192 Hiroshima \u2192 Tokyo). Use the [JR Pass Calculator](https://www.jrpass.com/farecalculator) to check.  \n  - *Alternative*: Regional passes (e.g., Kansai-Hiroshima Pass) if focusing on one area.  \n- **Shinkansen (Bullet Trains)**: Book non-reserved seats if you don\u2019t have a JR Pass (cheaper).  \n- **Subways/Buses**: In cities, use IC cards (Suica/Pasmo) for convenience. Google Maps is *gold* for routes.  \n- **Buses**: Useful for rural areas (e.g., Takayama, Shirakawa-go).  \n\n*Pro Tip*: If skipping the JR Pass, book Shinkansen tickets online via **SmartEX App** (discounts for advance purchase).  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Payment Methods**  \n- **Cash**: Still king at small eateries, temples, and rural areas. Withdraw from 7-Eleven ATMs (best for int\u2019l cards).  \n- **IC Cards (Suica/Pasmo)**: Load money for trains, buses, vending machines, and even convenience stores. Buy at airport stations.  \n- **Credit Cards**: Accepted in hotels, department stores, and chain restaurants (Visa/Mastercard most common).  \n- **QR Codes**: Apps like PayPay are growing but not essential for tourists.  \n\n*Note*: Always carry \u00a51,000\u20133,000 in coins for lockers, temples, and buses!  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Customs & Etiquette**  \n- **Temples/Shrines**:  \n  - Bow slightly before entering torii gates.  \n  - Wash hands/mouth at *temizuya* (water pavilion) before praying.  \n  - Don\u2019t photograph prayer areas or monks without permission.  \n- **Onsens**:  \n  - Shower *thoroughly* before entering (no soap in the bath!).  \n  - No swimsuits\u2014nudity is required (separate gender areas).  \n  - Tie up long hair; don\u2019t let it touch the water.  \n- **General**:  \n  - No tipping (it\u2019s awkward).  \n  - Queue orderly for trains/buses.  \n  - Avoid eating while walking (okay at festivals).  \n\n*Fun Fact*: Slurping noodles = polite (it means you\u2019re enjoying the meal!).  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Staying Connected**  \n- **Pocket Wi-Fi**: Rent at the airport (e.g., Ninja WiFi) for unlimited data and multiple devices.  \n- **Prepaid SIM**: Buy at airports (e.g., Sakura Mobile) if you prefer SIM over Wi-Fi.  \n- **Free Wi-Fi**: Spotty but available at convenience stores and some stations (install **Japan Connected-free Wi-Fi** app).  \n\n*Tip*: Book Wi-Fi/SIM online for airport pickup\u2014it\u2019s cheaper!  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udcc5 Sample 12-Day Itinerary (Mix of Culture/Food/Nature/Anime)**  \n**Day 1\u20134: Tokyo**  \n- **Day 1**: Shibuya (Crossing, Hachiko), Harajuku (Takeshita Street), Meiji Shrine.  \n- **Day 2**: Asakusa (Senso-ji), Akihabara (anime shopping), Ueno Park (museums or zoo).  \n- **Day 3**: Day trip to Nikko (Toshogu Shrine) or Hakone (onsen + Fuji views).  \n- **Day 4**: Studio Ghibli Museum (AM), Shimokitazawa (PM), Shinjuku Golden Gai at night.  \n\n**Day 5\u20138: Kyoto**  \n- **Day 5**: Fushimi Inari (early!), Nishiki Market, Gion at dusk.  \n- **Day 6**: Arashiyama (bamboo forest, monkey park), Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion).  \n- **Day 7**: Day trip to Nara (deer + Todai-ji) or Kurama/Kibune hike.  \n- **Day 8**: Philosopher\u2019s Path, Nanzen-ji, Pontocho Alley dinner.  \n\n**Day 9\u201310: Osaka**  \n- **Day 9**: Dotonbori (street food), Osaka Castle, Shinsekai.  \n- **Day 10**: Universal Studios *or* day trip to Himeji Castle + Kobe beef lunch.  \n\n**Day 11\u201312: Hiroshima/Miyajima or Kanazawa**  \n- **Option 1**: Peace Park (Hiroshima), Miyajima Island (overnight in ryokan).  \n- **Option 2**: Kanazawa (Kenrokuen Garden, samurai districts).  \n\n*Flex Days*: Add an onsen town (Kinosaki) or extra time in Kyoto.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83c\udf8c Themed Add-Ons**  \n- **Anime/Manga**: Nakano Broadway (Tokyo), Kyoto International Manga Museum.  \n- **Food Tours**: Tsukiji Outer Market (Tokyo), Kuromon Market (Osaka).  \n- **Nature**: Kamikochi (Alps) or Yakushima Island (if extending trip).  \n\nWould you like adjustments (e.g., more nature, less cities)?

Go by 6:30am for misty bamboo magic.  \n- **Kibune/Kurama Hike**: Add a half-day (start at Kibune, hike to Kurama Onsen to relax after).  \n- **Extra Nature**: **Philosopher\u2019s Path** (best in cherry/autumn season) or **Fushimi Inari at dawn** (even quieter than sunrise).  \n\n**Day 9\u201310: Osaka**  \n- **Osaka Castle**: Visit early or late to avoid crowds. The park around it is lovely.  \n- **Dotonbori Riverwalk**: Perfect at night when the neon lights reflect on the water.  \n\n**Day 11\u201312: Kanazawa**  \n- **Kenrokuen Garden**: One of Japan\u2019s top 3 gardens\u2014go at opening for serenity.  \n- **Samurai Districts**: **Nagamachi** has preserved samurai houses (cool museum there).  \n- **Add**: **Omicho Market** (seafood bowls!) or a short trip to **Shirakawa-go** (thatched-roof villages) if you\u2019re up for a bus ride.  \n\n**Themed Add-Ons**:  \n- **Food Tour**: **Tsukiji Outer Market (Tokyo)** or **Kuromon Market (Osaka)**.  \n- **Manga**: **Kyoto International Manga Museum** (cool for browsing + drawing workshops).  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83e\uddf3 Packing Tips for Japan**  \n**Essentials**:  \n- **Comfortable Shoes**: You\u2019ll walk *a lot* (10\u201320k steps/day). Bring cushioned sneakers or walking sandals (e.g., Tevas).  \n- **Coin Purse**: Japan runs on \u00a5100/500 coins (for lockers, buses, temples). A zippered pouch is a lifesaver!  \n- **Layers**: Weather shifts fast\u2014light jacket, scarf, and moisture-wicking clothes (spring/fall). Summer = breathable fabrics + umbrella (sudden rain).  \n- **Onsen Kit**: Small towel (rentals available), toiletries (ryokans often provide them, but bring travel-sized ones for hostels).  \n\n**Tech/Extras**:  \n- **Portable Charger**: For long days out.  \n- **Foldable Tote**: For shopping (stores charge for bags now).  \n- **Slippers**: Some guesthouses/ryokans require indoor shoes (or provide disposable ones).  \n\n**Pro Tips**:  \n- **Pack Light**: Trains have limited luggage space (forward big bags via **Yamato Transport** between cities).  \n- **Google Translate App**: Download Japanese offline\u2014helpful for menus/signs.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude86 JR Pass & Transport Refresher**  \n- **Activate JR Pass at Airport**: Use it for the **Narita Express** (Tokyo) or **Haruka Express** (Kyoto) right away.  \n- **Reserve Shinkansen Seats**: Free with JR Pass\u2014do it at station offices (or use SmartEX if no pass).  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83c\udf5c Foodie Bonus**  \n- **Must-Try**:  \n  - **Tokyo**: Tsukiji tuna bowls, tempura at **Daikokuya** (Asakusa).  \n  - **Kyoto**: Matcha parfaits (Nishiki Market), yudofu (tofu hot pot).  \n  - **Osaka**: Okonomiyaki at **Mizuno**, kushikatsu (Shinsekai).  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**  \nYour plan is already fantastic!
