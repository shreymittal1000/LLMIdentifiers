Nikko (2-hour train ride)**  \n- **Why go?** Lush mountains, UNESCO World Heritage temples, and autumn foliage (best in October/November).  \n- **Must-sees:**  \n  - **Toshogu Shrine:** Lavishly decorated burial site of Tokugawa Ieyasu (the shogun who unified Japan).  \n  - **Kegon Falls:** One of Japan\u2019s tallest waterfalls (take the elevator down for a close-up view).  \n  - **Shinkyo Bridge:** A sacred red bridge over a rushing river.  \n- **How to get there:**  \n  - **Budget option:** Tobu Railway from Asakusa (about \u00a52,800 round-trip with a local train).  \n  - **Faster option:** JR Pass covers the Shinkansen to Utsunomiya + local train (\u00a55,000+ without pass).  \n\n#### **2. Hakone (1.5-hour train ride)**  \n- **Why go?** Hot springs (onsen), views of Mt. Fuji (on clear days), and the famous \"Hakone Loop\" (train, cable car, pirate ship, and bus).  \n- **Must-sees:**  \n  - **Owakudani:** Volcanic valley with sulfur vents and black eggs (said to add 7 years to your life!).  \n  - **Lake Ashi:** Scenic boat ride with torii gate views.  \n  - **Open-Air Museum:** Stunning art installations in nature.  \n- **How to get there:**  \n  - **Romancecar train** from Shinjuku (\u00a52,300 one-way; reserved seats, super comfy).  \n  - **Cheaper option:** Odakyu Line + Hakone Free Pass (\u00a56,100 for 2-day transport + discounts).  \n\n**Verdict:** Pick Nikko for history/nature, Hakone for relaxation/Fuji views!  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udcb0 Budget-Friendly Tips**  \n#### **Accommodation:**  \n- **Capsule hotels** (\u00a52,000\u2013\u00a54,000/night) \u2013 Try **Nine Hours** or **First Cabin**.  \n- **Business hotels** (\u00a55,000\u2013\u00a58,000/night) \u2013 Reliable chains like **Toyoko Inn** or **APA Hotel**.  \n- **Hostels** \u2013 **Unplan Kagurazaka** (Tokyo) or **Piece Hostel Kyoto** (great for socializing).  \n\n#### **Food:**  \n- **Convenience stores (7-Eleven, Lawson, FamilyMart):** Onigiri (\u00a5120), bento boxes (\u00a5500), and egg sandwiches!  \n- **Standing ramen bars** (\u00a5500\u2013\u00a5900) \u2013 Look for tiny shops with vending machine ordering.  \n- **Depachika (department store basements):** Discounted gourmet food after 7 PM.  \n\n#### **Transport:**  \n- **Pasmo/Suica IC card** (reloadable for trains/buses).  \n- **Avoid taxis** (they\u2019re *very* expensive).  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Essential Japanese Phrases**  \nWhile many signs are in English, locals *love* when you try speaking Japanese! Key phrases:  \n- **Konnichiwa** (Hello)  \n- **Sumimasen** (Excuse me / Sorry) \u2013 *Super* useful in crowds.  \n- **___ wa doko desu ka?** (Where is ___?)  \n- **Oishii desu!** (It\u2019s delicious!) \u2013 Say this to chefs; they\u2019ll beam!  \n- **Eigo no menyu arimasu ka?** (Do you have an English menu?)  \n\n**English in Japan:**  \n- Major cities/tourist spots: Enough English to get by.  \n- Rural areas: Minimal. Use **Google Translate** (download Japanese offline) or point at things!  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83c\udf8c Extra Pro Tips:**  \n- **Pocket WiFi/SIM card:** Rent at the airport for navigation (Google Maps works perfectly).  \n- **Temple etiquette:** Bow slightly before entering, don\u2019t photograph where prohibited.  \n- **Trash cans:** Rare!
