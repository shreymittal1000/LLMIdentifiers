Destination Comparison**  \n\n#### **\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddff New Zealand**  \n**Pros:**  \n- **Outdoor Paradise**: Epic hiking (Tongariro Alpine Crossing, Milford Track), bungee jumping, and fjord cruises.  \n- **Stunning Scenery**: Mountains, beaches, and LOTR filming locations.  \n- **Safe & Easy Travel**: English-speaking, great infrastructure for road trips.  \n\n**Cons:**  \n- **Expensive**: Flights and activities (e.g., helicopter tours) can add up.  \n- **Remote**: Long flight from most places.  \n\n**Budget Fit**: Doable if you prioritize hikes over luxury (hostels/campgrounds). Flights may eat ~$1,200\u2013$1,500 of your budget.  \n\n---\n\n#### **\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9 Italy**  \n**Pros:**  \n- **Culture Overload**: Ancient ruins (Rome), Renaissance art (Florence), and coastal charm (Amalfi, Cinque Terre).  \n- **Food & Wine**: Pizza, pasta, gelato, and Tuscan vineyards.  \n- **Beaches**: Sardinia and Sicily offer relaxation.  \n\n**Cons:**  \n- **Crowds**: Peak season (summer) can be overwhelming.  \n- **Less Adventure**: More about strolling and savoring than adrenaline.  \n\n**Budget Fit**: Great! Trains are affordable, and mid-range hotels fit your range. Flights ~$800\u2013$1,200.  \n\n---\n\n#### **\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf7 Costa Rica**  \n**Pros:**  \n- **Wildlife & Adventure**: Zip-lining, surfing, sloth-spotting, and volcano hikes (Arenal).  \n- **Beaches**: Caribbean (Puerto Viejo) and Pacific (Manuel Antonio).  \n- **Budget-Friendly**: Cheaper than NZ/Italy for food and lodging.  \n\n**Cons:**  \n- **Rainy Season**: Downpours can disrupt plans (see weather below).  \n- **Less History**: Focused on nature over museums.  \n\n**Budget Fit**: Ideal! Flights ~$500\u2013$900, leaving room for tours/eco-lodges.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Time of Year & Weather** \u26c5  \n**This is CRUCIAL!** Here\u2019s the best timing for each:  \n\n- **New Zealand**:  \n  - **Best**: Nov\u2013Apr (summer/fall). Avoid Jun\u2013Aug (cold, some trails close).  \n  - **Tip**: Feb\u2013Mar has fewer crowds.  \n\n- **Italy**:  \n  - **Best**: Apr\u2013Jun or Sep\u2013Oct (mild weather, fewer tourists). Avoid Jul\u2013Aug (hot + packed).  \n  - **Beaches**: May\u2013Sep for swimming.  \n\n- **Costa Rica**:  \n  - **Best**: Dec\u2013Apr (dry season). Avoid Sep\u2013Oct (heaviest rain).  \n  - **Bonus**: Apr is \"shoulder season\"\u2014cheaper but still sunny.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Which Fits You Best?**  \n- **Choose New Zealand** if you prioritize jaw-dropping landscapes and adrenaline.  \n- **Choose Italy** if food, history, and leisurely exploration call to you.  \n- **Choose Costa Rica** for wildlife + adventure on a relaxed budget.  \n\n**Wildcard Idea**: If you\u2019re torn, pair **Costa Rica + a short Italy stop** (e.g., Rome for 3 days) with multi-city flights!  \n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**  \n1. **Check flight prices** for your ideal months.  \n2. **Skim itineraries** (e.g., 10 days in NZ\u2019s South Island vs. 2 weeks in Italy).  \n3. **Ask yourself**: Do I want action, culture, or a mix?  \n\nWant me to sketch a rough itinerary for one? \ud83d\ude0a  \n\n*P.S. My personal vote? Costa Rica for your love of hiking + beaches + budget, but Italy if food/history wins your heart!*"
