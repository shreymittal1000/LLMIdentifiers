Get a **JR Pass** if you're traveling between cities.\n   - IC cards (like Suica or Pasmo) are handy for local transport.\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - From sushi and ramen to street food like takoyaki, Japanese cuisine is diverse and delicious.\n   - Don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re handed a hot towel (oshibori) before meals!\n\n5. **Seasonal Highlights**:\n   - **Spring (March-May)**: Cherry blossoms (sakura) are magical!\n   - **Autumn (October-November)**: Stunning fall foliage.\n   - **Winter (December-February)**: Great for skiing in Hokkaido or onsens (hot springs).\n\n### \ud83d\uddfc **Must-Visit Places**:\n- **Tokyo**: Shibuya Crossing, Akihabara (for anime/tech), and serene spots like Meiji Shrine.\n- **Kyoto**: Temples (Kinkaku-ji), bamboo forests (Arashiyama), and geisha culture in Gion.\n- **Osaka**: Dotonbori for street food and vibrant nightlife.\n- **Hiroshima**: Peace Memorial Park and nearby Miyajima Island.\n- **Nara**: Friendly deer and Todai-ji Temple.\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 **Tips**:\n- Cash is still king in many places (though credit cards are becoming more accepted).\n- Convenience stores (like 7-Eleven or Lawson) are lifesavers for snacks, ATM withdrawals, and even hot meals.\n- Public trash cans are rare\u2014carry a small bag for your garbage.\n\nWould you like recommendations based on your interests (e.g., history, food, nature)?

Should I get a JR Pass, or use local transportation?\n\nLastly, I've heard that Japan can be quite expensive, so I'd love to get some tips on how to save money while still having a great time.

Let\u2019s tackle your remaining questions one by one:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude86 **JR Pass vs. Individual Tickets (Cost Breakdown)**:\nFor **Tokyo \u2192 Kyoto \u2192 Osaka \u2192 (Hiroshima)**, here\u2019s a rough estimate (prices in JPY as of 2024):\n\n| Route                | Individual Ticket (Shinkansen) | JR Pass (7-day: \u00a550,000) |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Tokyo \u2192 Kyoto        | ~\u00a513,000 (one-way)            | **Covered**              |\n| Kyoto \u2192 Osaka        | ~\u00a51,500 (local JR train)      | **Covered**              |\n| Osaka \u2192 Hiroshima    | ~\u00a510,000 (one-way)            | **Covered**              |\n| Hiroshima \u2192 Tokyo    | ~\u00a519,000 (one-way)            | **Covered**              |\n| **Total**            | ~\u00a543,500+                     | \u00a550,000                  |\n\n**Verdict**:  \n- If you\u2019re doing **round-trip Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka**, individual tickets (~\u00a530,000) are cheaper than the JR Pass.  \n- If adding **Hiroshima**, the JR Pass pays off (saves ~\u00a56,500).  \n- **Alternative**: A **7-day pass** only makes sense if you cram long-distance trips within 7 days. For a 10-day trip, activate it mid-trip (e.g., Day 3-9).  \n\n**Other Transport Options**:  \n- **Overnight buses**: Tokyo-Kyoto (~\u00a55,000-8,000; saves on a night\u2019s accommodation).  \n- **Regional passes**: Like the **Kansai-Hiroshima Pass** (\u00a515,000/5 days) if skipping Tokyo.  \n- **Subways/IC Cards**: Use Suica/Pasmo in cities (not covered by JR Pass).  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf89 **Seasonal Events & Festivals**:\nHere are some highlights (dates vary yearly; check Japan National Tourism Organization for updates):  \n\n#### **Spring (March-May)**:\n- **Sakura Festivals**: Late March-early April in Tokyo (Ueno Park), Kyoto (Maruyama Park), and Hiroshima (Peace Park).  \n- **Sanja Matsuri (Tokyo, May)**: One of Tokyo\u2019s wildest festivals, with mikoshi (portable shrine) parades in Asakusa.  \n\n#### **Summer (June-August)**:\n- **Gion Matsuri (Kyoto, July)**: Month-long festival with massive floats and traditional processions.  \n- **Tenjin Matsuri (Osaka, July)**: Fireworks and boat processions on the river.  \n\n#### **Autumn (September-November)**:\n- **Jidai Matsuri (Kyoto, Oct 22)**: A parade celebrating Kyoto\u2019s history with period costumes.  \n- **Kurobe Unazuki Canyon (Toyama, Oct-Nov)**: Stunning autumn foliage train ride.  \n\n#### **Winter (December-February)**:\n- **Illuminations**: Tokyo (Roppongi, Shinjuku) and Osaka (Midosuji Blvd) dazzle with lights.  \n- **Sapporo Snow Festival (Hokkaido, Feb)**: Ice sculptures and snow slides (worth a flight if you extend north!).  \n\n**Pro Tip**: Festivals get crowded\u2014book accommodations early!  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfe8 **Affordable Accommodation Tips**:\n- **Business Hotels**: **Toyoko Inn**, **APA Hotel** (~\u00a55,000-8,000/night).
