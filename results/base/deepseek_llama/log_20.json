Let\u2019s tackle your questions one by one to ensure your trip is smooth, immersive, and unforgettable.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude86 1. Public Transportation in Japan**  \nJapan\u2019s public transport is *incredibly* efficient but can seem daunting at first. Here\u2019s how to master it:  \n- **Trains/Subways:**  \n  - **Apps:** Use **Google Maps** (works perfectly for routes/schedules) or **Japan Travel by Navitime** (more detailed for JR Pass options).  \n  - **IC Cards:** Get a **Suica** (Tokyo) or **ICOCA** (Osaka) for seamless travel on trains/buses/convenience stores. *Pro tip:* You can use Suica nationwide now!  \n  - **JR Pass:** If doing Tokyo \u2192 Kyoto \u2192 Hiroshima, a **7-day JR Pass** (around \u00a550,000) pays off. Activate it when leaving Tokyo.  \n- **Buses:**  \n  - Kyoto\u2019s buses are great for reaching temples (buy a **1-day bus pass** for \u00a5700).  \n  - **Highway buses** (e.g., Willer Express) are cheaper than Shinkansen for long distances if you\u2019re on a budget.  \n- **Taxis:** Expensive but useful late at night (when trains stop around midnight).  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83c\udf89 2. Anime/Manga Events**  \nCheck these resources for event dates:  \n- **Comiket (Comic Market):** Held in **August** and **December** at Tokyo Big Sight. Massive doujinshi (fan-made manga) fair\u2014prepare for crowds!  \n- **Tokyo Anime Award Festival:** Late **March** (screenings and industry events).  \n- **Jump Festa:** **December** (for Shonen Jump fans).  \n- **AnimeJapan:** Late **March** (exhibitions and merch).  \n- **Local Events:** Search **Akiba Info** or **Tokyo Cheapo** for pop-up events, themed caf\u00e9s, or collaborations.  \n\n*Booking tip:* Some events (like Ghibli Museum) require tickets **months** in advance.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83c\udfef 3. Exploring Historical Sites**  \n- **Guided Tours:**  \n  - **Kyoto:** Small-group **samurai/ninja tours** (try **Samurai Kembu Kyoto** for sword performances).  \n  - **Tokyo:** **Free walking tours** (like Tokyo Free Guide) or paid history tours in Asakusa.  \n  - **Hiroshima:** Peace Memorial Park offers **volunteer-led English tours**.  \n- **Audio Guides:** Many major sites (e.g., Osaka Castle, Nijo Castle) rent English audio guides (~\u00a5500).  \n- **DIY Option:** Grab a **Lonely Planet guidebook** or use **Japan Official Travel App** for offline maps/historical context.  \n\n*Pro tip:* Temples/shrines often have English pamphlets\u2014look for them at entrances!  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83c\udf63 4. Food Scene Must-Dos**  \n#### **Must-Try Dishes by City:**  \n- **Tokyo:**  \n  - **Sushi:** Daiwa Sushi (Tsukiji Outer Market) or conveyor-belt sushi like **Sushiro**.  \n  - **Ramen:** Ichiran (tonkotsu) or Afuri (yuzu-flavored).  \n- **Kyoto:**  \n  - **Kaiseki:** Multi-course haute cuisine (try **Kikunoi** for splurge, Giro Giro for budget).  \n  - **Yudofu:** Tofu hot pot (at **Nanzen-ji Junsei**).  \n- **Osaka:**  \n  - **Takoyaki:** A must in Dotonbori (try **Kukuru**).  \n  - **Kushikatsu:** Deep-fried skewers (Daruma is famous).  \n- **Hiroshima:** **Okonomiyaki** (layered style, try Okonomi-mura).  \n\n#### **Food Experiences:**  \n- **Depachika:** Basement floors of department stores (e.g., Isetan Shinjuku) for gourmet bentos.  \n- **Izakaya Hopping:** Try **Omoide Yokocho** (Tokyo) or **Hozenji Yokocho** (Osaka) for tiny bars.  \n- **Conveyor-Belt Sushi:** **Kura Sushi** or **Genki Sushi** for fun, affordable options.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83c\udf8e Cultural Tips & Etiquette**  \n- **Bowing:** A slight nod is fine; deeper bows are for formal situations.  \n- **Shoes Off:** In ryokans, temples, and some restaurants (look for shoe racks or tatami floors).  \n- **Chopsticks:** Don\u2019t stick them upright in rice (resembles funeral rites).  \n- **Tipping:** Not expected\u2014it can even confuse staff!  \n- **Quiet Trains:** Avoid loud calls or phone chats on public transport.  \n- **Garbage Bins:** Rare! Carry a small bag for trash (recycling is strict).  \n\n*Pro tip:* If unsure, observe locals or say **\u201cSumimasen\u201d** (Excuse me) to ask politely.  \n\n---\n\n### **\u23f3 Maximizing Your Time**  \n- **Prioritize:** Pick 2\u20133 \u201cmust-dos\u201d per day and leave room for spontaneity (like stumbling upon a festival!).  \n- **Early Mornings:** Visit popular sites (Fushimi Inari, Senso-ji) at sunrise to avoid crowds.  \n- **Late Nights:** Explore **Golden Gai** (Tokyo) or **Pontocho Alley** (Kyoto) for atmospheric drinks.  \n- **Pocket Wi-Fi:** Rent one for seamless navigation and last-minute research.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Itinerary Tweaks**  \nIf adding **Kanazawa**, consider:  \n- **Day 6:** Tokyo \u2192 Kanazawa (2.5h via Hokuriku Shinkansen).  \n- **Day 7:** Kenrokuen Garden + Samurai District \u2192 Evening train to Kyoto (2h).  \n\nThis keeps your trip balanced without feeling rushed!  \n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like adjustments (e.g., more hidden gems, budget hacks, or seasonal activities).
