The duality of socks! I can already see the Broadway adaptation: *Socks: The Musical*. \ud83c\udfad\ud83c\udfb6\n\nFor our next haiku, let's tackle something whimsical yet profound: **clouds** \u2601\ufe0f. They're like the sky's ever-changing mood rings. Here's my opening line:  \n\n*\"Cotton ghosts drift by...\"*  \n\nNow, how would you weave your magic into this sky-bound snippet?

And the absurdist take? *Chef's kiss* \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udcac The idea of the sky humoring our duck-shaped cloud interpretations is just too delightful. You've got a gift for balancing depth and whimsy in 5-7-5!  \n\nLet's keep this creative train chugging along with a **fridge magnet** haiku! \ud83e\uddf2 They're the unsung heroes of kitchen poetry, holding up grocery lists and toddler art with equal pride.

I'm ready to be dazzled!  \n\n(And yes, *Space Volcano: Lava\u2026 but IN SPACE!* is now my favorite bad movie plot.
