Let\u2019s break it down, plus explore Okinawa/Zanzibar as alternatives, and then craft your dream Santorini itinerary!  \n\n---\n\n### **\u2708\ufe0f Combining Santorini + Bora Bora (or Maldives)**  \n**Feasibility:** Yes! But logistics matter.  \n- **Route:** Fly into **Athens** (2-3 days for Acropolis/museums) \u2192 **Santorini** (5-7 days) \u2192 **Bora Bora** (via LAX or PPT, 4-5 days).  \n- **Time Split:**  \n  - **Santorini (5-7 days):** Enough for ruins, wineries, beaches, and day trips (like volcano tours).  \n  - **Bora Bora/Maldives (4-5 days):** Ideal for snorkeling, overwater villa relaxation, and lagoon tours.  \n- **Pro Tip:** Book flights with a stopover in **Los Angeles or Dubai** to break up long travel.  \n\n**Why It Works:**  \n- Start with **Santorini\u2019s energy** (exploring, hiking, eating), then **unwind in Bora Bora** with zero plans but the ocean.  \n- **Budget Hack:** Use points for flights (Bora Bora is pricey, but Santorini has mid-range options).  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83c\udf34 Wildcard Alternatives: Okinawa or Zanzibar**  \nIf you want **culture + snorkeling in one place**, these are stellar:  \n\n#### **1. Okinawa, Japan**  \n- **Culture:** Unique Ryukyu heritage (shisa lions, Shuri Castle), Okinawan cuisine (goya champuru, purple sweet potato treats).  \n- **Snorkeling:** **Kerama Islands** (crystal water, sea turtles), **Blue Cave** (like Capri but quieter).  \n- **Vibe:** Mix of Japanese precision and island chill. Less touristy than Santorini!  \n\n#### **2. Zanzibar, Tanzania**  \n- **Culture:** Stone Town\u2019s spice markets, Arab-Persian architecture, Swahili cuisine (urojo soup, Zanzibar pizza).  \n- **Snorkeling:** **Mnemba Atoll** (dolphins!), **Prison Island** (giant tortoises).  \n- **Vibe:** Exotic, adventurous, with luxurious beach resorts (like The Rock Restaurant).  \n\n**Why Consider These?**  \n- **Single-destination simplicity** (no long flights between Europe/Polynesia).  \n- **Okinawa** is safer/easier for solo travel; **Zanzibar** pairs well with a safari.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udcc5 Your 7-Day Santorini Itinerary**  \n*(If you choose to focus here first!)*  \n\n**Day 1-2: Fira & Akrotiri**  \n- Explore **Fira\u2019s cliffside alleys**, visit the **Archaeological Museum**.  \n- Sunset at **Skaros Rock**.  \n- Day trip to **Akrotiri ruins** + **Red Beach**.  \n\n**Day 3: Oia & Wine**  \n- Sunrise in **Oia** (beat the crowds!), browse art galleries.  \n- Afternoon wine tour at **Santo Wines** or **Venetsanos Winery**.  \n- Sunset dinner at **Amoudi Bay** (try lobster spaghetti).  \n\n**Day 4: Hike & Hidden Gems**  \n- **Fira to Oia hike** (3-4 hours, epic views).  \n- Lunch in **Imerovigli** (less touristy, same views).  \n- Chill at **Vlychada Beach** (moon-like cliffs).  \n\n**Day 5: Boat Day**  \n- **Catamaran cruise** with stops at hot springs, Thirassia island.  \n- Snorkel at **Nea Kameni**\u2019s volcanic bays.  \n\n**Day 6: Pyrgos & Megalochori**  \n- **Pyrgos village** (360\u00b0 views from its castle).  \n- **Megalochori** for traditional cave houses.  \n- Cooking class (learn to make **moussaka**!).  \n\n**Day 7: Relax & Souvenirs**  \n- Beach day at **Kamari** (black sand) or **Perissa**.  \n- Last-minute shopping for **Santorini capers, local art**.  \n\n**Bonus:** If you have extra time, take a ferry to **Milos** (even quieter, with surreal beaches like Sarakiniko).  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**  \n- **Santorini + Bora Bora combo** = Ultimate \"adventure + pampering\" trip (if you\u2019re okay with long flights).  \n- **Okinawa/Zanzibar** = Streamlined cultural + snorkeling fix.  \n- **Santorini solo** = Deep dive into Greek beauty (with a side of wine!).  \n\nWhat excites you most?

The response style also matches GPT's tendency to use emojis, section headers, and bullet points for clarity.",
