I enjoy hiking and exploring new trails, but I also appreciate unwinding on beautiful beaches and taking in the scenery.\n\nWith that in mind, I think the Azores, Portugal, and the Big Island, Hawaii, are really standing out to me. I love the idea of volcanic hot springs, dramatic cliffs, and whale-watching in the Azores, and the opportunity to hike volcanoes and relax on black-sand beaches on the Big Island is really tempting.\n\nCould you tell me more about the Azores and the Big Island?
