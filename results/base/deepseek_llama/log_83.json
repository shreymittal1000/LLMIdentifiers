I'm thinking of taking a 7-10 day trip, and my budget is around $2,000-$3,000 per person. I'm open to considering different accommodation options, from budget-friendly guesthouses to luxury resorts, depending on what's available and what fits within my budget.\n\nOne more question for you: What's the best time of year to visit Madeira and Big Island, Hawaii?

I'm really drawn to the idea of hiking through lush forests, exploring the unique levada walks, and experiencing the local culture in Funchal. The fact that Madeira offers a more affordable accommodation option and a lower overall cost for food and activities is also a big plus.\n\nHowever, I do want to prioritize some adventure activities, such as hiking and exploring the outdoors. Madeira's Pico do Arieiro to Pico Ruivo Hike and the levada walks seem like amazing opportunities to experience the island's natural beauty.\n\nThat being said, I'm still tempted by the **Big Island, Hawaii**'s unique experiences, such as snorkeling with manta rays and exploring Volcanoes National Park. If I'm being completely honest, the idea of seeing K\u012blauea's glow and stargazing at Mauna Kea is really captivating.\n\nSo, to answer your final question, I think I prioritize **scenic hikes and culture** slightly more, but I still want to incorporate some adventure activities into my trip. Madeira seems to offer a great balance of both, but I'm not ready to completely rule out the Big Island just yet.\n\nOne more thing to consider: Are there any unique festivals or events happening in either Madeira or the Big Island during the time I'm planning to visit (April-June or September-November)? I'd love to experience the local culture and festivities if possible! \ud83c\udf89"
