Follow it with biking down the volcano.  \n\u2714 **Road to Hana** \u2013 Waterfalls, black sand beaches (Waianapanapa), and banana bread stops.  \n\u2714 **Snorkeling at Molokini Crater** or **Turtle Town** (sea turtles galore!).  \n\u2714 **Pipiwai Trail** \u2013 Bamboo forests + 400-ft waterfall (bring waterproof shoes!).  \n\u2714 **Luau at Old Lahaina** \u2013 For Hawaiian culture and fire dancing.  \n\n### **\ud83c\udf34 Phuket, Thailand**  \n**Best Time to Visit:**  \n- **November\u2013February** (Cool, dry season\u2014best for beaches/hikes).  \n- Avoid **May\u2013October** (monsoon season, though fewer tourists).  \n\n**Must-Do Experiences:**  \n\u2714 **Island Hopping** \u2013 Phi Phi Islands, James Bond Island, or Similan Islands (snorkeling heaven).  \n\u2714 **Khao Sok National Park** \u2013 Stay in a floating bungalow, hike to hidden lagoons.  \n\u2714 **Big Buddha Phuket** \u2013 Stunning views + cultural experience.  \n\u2714 **Phang Nga Bay Kayaking** \u2013 Paddle through caves and emerald waters.  \n\u2714 **Night Markets (Phuket Weekend Market)** \u2013 Try mango sticky rice, pad thai, and fresh coconuts!  \n\n### **\ud83d\udcb0 Budget Note:**  \n- **Maui** is pricier (especially accommodations/rental cars).  \n- **Phuket** is more budget-friendly (luxury resorts can still be affordable).  \n\n**Which excites you more?**  \n- **Maui** = Road trips, volcanic landscapes, and Hawaiian culture.  \n- **Phuket** = Island-hopping, jungle adventures, and Thai street food.  \n\nOr\u2026 why not both? \ud83d\ude09 (Multi-destination trips are *cheaper* from Asia to Hawaii!)"

I'd love to experience the cool, dry season and enjoy the beaches and hikes without the crowds. \ud83c\udf1e\n\nThe must-do experiences in Phuket also sound incredibly exciting!

Should I start with Phuket and then head to Maui, or vice versa? And are there any specific airlines or routes that you'd recommend for a multi-destination trip? \ud83d\udeeb\ufe0f\n\nLastly, what's the approximate cost for a 7-10 day trip to Phuket, and how does it compare to a similar trip to Maui? \ud83d\udcca I'd love to get a rough estimate to help me plan my budget. \ud83d\udcb8"
