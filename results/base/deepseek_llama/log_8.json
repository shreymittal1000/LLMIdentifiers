Here\u2019s a quick guide to help you plan:  \n\n### \ud83c\udf38 **Best Time to Visit**  \n- **Spring (March\u2013May)**: Famous for cherry blossoms (*sakura*), especially late March to early April. Mild weather but crowded.  \n- **Autumn (October\u2013November)**: Stunning fall foliage, pleasant temps, and fewer crowds than spring.  \n- **Winter (December\u2013February)**: Great for skiing (Hokkaido), hot springs (*onsen*), and festive lights. Avoid if you dislike cold.  \n- **Summer (June\u2013September)**: Hot/humid, but lively festivals (*matsuri*) like Gion Matsuri (July). Risk of rain/typhoons.  \n\n### \ud83d\uddfc **Must-See Places**  \n1. **Tokyo** \u2013 Neon-lit streets, Shibuya Crossing, Senso-ji Temple, Akihabara (for anime/gaming), and Tsukiji Outer Market.  \n2. **Kyoto** \u2013 Temples (Kinkaku-ji, Fushimi Inari\u2019s torii gates), Gion district (geisha culture), and bamboo forests (Arashiyama).  \n3. **Osaka** \u2013 Foodie paradise (Dotonbori street), Universal Studios Japan, and Osaka Castle.  \n4. **Hiroshima** \u2013 Peace Memorial Park and nearby Miyajima Island (floating torii gate).  \n5. **Nara** \u2013 Friendly deer and Todai-ji Temple (giant Buddha).  \n6. **Hokkaido** \u2013 Powder snow (winter) or lavender fields (summer in Furano).  \n7. **Okinawa** \u2013 Tropical beaches and unique Ryukyu culture.  \n\n### \u2728 **Bonus Tips**  \n- **Transport**: Get a **JR Pass** (if traveling between cities) and use IC cards (Suica/Pasmo) for local transit.  \n- **Etiquette**: Bow politely, don\u2019t eat while walking, and learn basic phrases like *arigato* (thank you).  \n- **Food**: Try sushi, ramen, okonomiyaki, and matcha treats!  \n\nWould you like recommendations for off-the-beaten-path spots or specific interests (e.g., hiking, anime, history)? \ud83d\ude0a"
