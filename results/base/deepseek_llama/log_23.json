Here\u2019s a quick guide to help you get started:\n\n### **Best Time to Visit:**\n- **Spring (March\u2013May):** Cherry blossom season (late March\u2013early April) is magical, but also crowded. Mild weather makes it ideal for sightseeing.  \n- **Autumn (October\u2013November):** Stunning fall foliage, comfortable temperatures, and fewer tourists than spring.  \n- **Avoid:** June (rainy season) and August (hot, humid, and busy with Obon festivals).  \n\n### **Must-See Places:**\n1. **Tokyo:**  \n   - Shibuya Crossing, Shinjuku (Golden Gai), Asakusa (Senso-ji Temple), Akihabara (for anime/tech), and Tsukiji Outer Market for sushi.  \n   - Day trip to Nikko or Kamakura for temples/nature.  \n\n2. **Kyoto:**  \n   - Fushimi Inari Shrine (famous torii gates), Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion), Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, and Gion (geisha district).  \n   - Try a tea ceremony or kaiseki (traditional multi-course meal).  \n\n3. **Osaka:**  \n   - Dotonbori for street food (takoyaki, okonomiyaki), Osaka Castle, and Universal Studios Japan.  \n\n4. **Hiroshima & Miyajima:**  \n   - Peace Memorial Park and the iconic \"floating\" torii gate at Itsukushima Shrine.  \n\n5. **Hokkaido (winter) or Okinawa (summer):** For skiing or tropical beaches, respectively.  \n\n### **First-Timer Tips:**\n- **Transport:** Get a **JR Pass** *only* if taking multiple Shinkansen (bullet train) trips\u2014calculate if it\u2019s worth it. IC cards (Suica/Pasmo) are handy for local transit.  \n- **Etiquette:** Bow slightly when greeting, don\u2019t tip, and avoid eating while walking.  \n- **Cash:** Many places (especially rural) are cash-only\u2014withdraw yen at 7-Eleven ATMs.  \n- **Food:** Try ramen, sushi, tempura, and izakayas (pub-style dining). Don\u2019t miss convenience store snacks (onigiri, melon pan)!  \n- **Language:** Learn basic phrases like *arigato* (thank you) and *sumimasen* (excuse me). Google Translate works well.  \n\n### **Bonus:**  \n- Stay in a **ryokan** (traditional inn) for a night with onsen (hot spring) access.  \n- Book popular restaurants/attractions in advance (e.g., TeamLab Planets, Ghibli Museum).  \n\nWould you like recommendations tailored to specific interests (e.g., hiking, anime, history)? Or help with an itinerary? Happy to dive deeper! \u2728\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5"
