Must-Visit Cities & Attractions**  \n- **Tokyo**:  \n  - Shibuya Crossing, Shinjuku (Golden Gai), Akihabara (for anime/gaming fans).  \n  - Meiji Shrine, Senso-ji Temple.  \n  - Day trip to Nikko or Hakone (onsen & Mt. Fuji views).  \n- **Kyoto**:  \n  - Fushimi Inari Shrine (famous torii gates).  \n  - Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion), Arashiyama Bamboo Forest.  \n  - Gion district (geisha culture).  \n- **Osaka**:  \n  - Dotonbori (street food heaven\u2014try takoyaki & okonomiyaki).  \n  - Universal Studios Japan (if you like theme parks).  \n- **Hiroshima**: Peace Memorial Park & Miyajima Island (floating torii gate).  \n- **Nara**: Friendly deer & Todai-ji Temple (giant Buddha).  \n\n### **3.
