Let\u2019s dive into the details:\n\n---\n\n### **1. ECO-LODGES: SUSTAINABILITY & VIEWS**  \nHere\u2019s a deeper look at your top eco-lodge options, ranked by *sustainability* and *views*:  \n\n#### **\ud83c\udfc6 Lapa Rios (Osa Peninsula)**  \n- **Why?** *National Geographic* recognized this lodge for conservation efforts.  \n- **Sustainability:**  \n  - Protects 1,000+ acres of rainforest.  \n  - Runs on solar power, uses biodegradable products, and supports local schools.  \n- **Views:** Ocean-meets-jungle panoramas from private bungalows.  \n\n#### **\ud83c\udf0b Nayara Tented Camp (Arenal)**  \n- **Why?** Adults-only luxury with volcano views.  \n- **Sustainability:** Carbon-neutral, reforestation projects, and employs locals.  \n- **Views:** Private decks with hot tubs facing Arenal Volcano.  \n\n#### **\ud83c\udf0a Arenas del Mar (Manuel Antonio)**  \n- **Why?** Beachfront + rainforest in one.  \n- **Sustainability:** 5-star LEED certification, protects endangered squirrel monkeys.  \n- **Views:** Oceanfront suites with direct beach access.  \n\n#### **\u2615 Finca Rosa Blanca (Near San Jos\u00e9)**  \n- **Why?** Coffee farm with art-filled villas.  \n- **Sustainability:** Organic farming, water recycling, and 100% carbon-neutral.  \n- **Views:** Valley and coffee plantation vistas.  \n\n*Pro Tip:* Book **Nayara** for romance, **Lapa Rios** for raw nature, and **Arenas del Mar** for convenience.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. TRANSPORT: TO RENT OR NOT TO RENT?**  \n**\ud83d\ude97 4x4 Rental:**  \n- **Necessary?** Only if you\u2019re comfortable with:  \n  - **Rough roads** (Monteverde, Santa Teresa, Osa Peninsula).  \n  - **River crossings** (common in Nicoya Peninsula).  \n- **Cost:** ~$50-$100/day (book with *Adobe Rent a Car* or *Vamos* \u2013 they include mandatory insurance).  \n\n**\ud83d\ude8d No-Car Alternative:**  \n- **Shared shuttles** (e.g., *Interbus*) cost ~$50-$100/leg.  \n- **Domestic flights** (Sansa Airlines) save time (e.g., San Jos\u00e9 \u2192 Puerto Jim\u00e9nez for Osa).  \n\n*Verdict:* Rent a 4x4 **only** if adding Osa Peninsula (roads are brutal there). Otherwise, shuttles/flights suffice.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. OFF-THE-BEATEN-PATH ACTIVITIES**  \nSkip the crowds with these hidden gems:  \n- **\ud83c\udfdd\ufe0f Playa San Josecito (Near Corcovado):** Secluded beach only accessible by boat.  \n- **\ud83c\udf0b Rio Perdido (Guanacaste):** Canyon hot springs and *blue river* hiking.  \n- **\ud83d\udc0d Osa Peninsula\u2019s Sirena Station:** Overnight in Corcovado\u2019s remotest ranger station (jaguars, tapirs!).  \n- **\ud83d\udea3 Palo Verde Boat Tour (Instead of Tortuguero):** Fewer tourists, same wildlife (crocs, monkeys).  \n\n---\n\n### **4. BUDGET BREAKDOWN (MID-RANGE)**  \n- **Eco-Lodges:** $200-$400/night (book direct for deals).  \n- **Tours:** $50-$150/activity (e.g., $120 for Arenal zip-lining, $80 for Manuel Antonio guided hike).  \n- **Food:** $10-$30/meal (*sodas* = cheap local eats).  \n- **Savings Tips:**  \n  - Travel in **May/June** (shoulder season = lower prices).  \n  - Book **multi-day tours** (discounts for bundles).  \n  - Skip fancy dinners \u2013 Costa Rican *casados* (plate lunches) are delicious and cheap!  \n\n---\n\n### **5. SAFETY UPDATE (2024)**  \n- **Areas to Avoid:**  \n  - **San Jos\u00e9\u2019s** *La Carpio* or *Desamparados* (stick to tourist areas like Escaz\u00fa).  \n  - **Lim\u00f3n city** (Caribbean port \u2013 sketchy at night).  \n- **Outdoor Safety:**  \n  - **Hiking:** Never hike alone in Corcovado/Osa (hire a guide \u2013 jaguars/snakes are real).  \n  - **Beaches:** Don\u2019t leave bags unattended (theft happens in Tamarindo/Jac\u00f3).  \n  - **Currents:** Rip tides are deadly \u2013 ask locals about swim conditions.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83c\udf3f ADDING OSA PENINSULA (3-4 EXTRA DAYS)**  \nIf you can stretch to **14-16 days**, here\u2019s how to include Osa:  \n1. **Fly SJO \u2192 Puerto Jim\u00e9nez** (1hr, ~$150 roundtrip).  \n2. **Stay:** *Lapa Rios* or *El Remanso* (both have private waterfalls!).  \n3. **Activities:**  \n   - **Corcovado Day Hike:** Spot scarlet macaws and tapirs.  \n   - **Night Jungle Walk:** Bioluminescent fungi and glass frogs.  \n   - **Kayak the Mangroves:** Dolphins and crocs!  \n\n*Itinerary Adjustment:*  \n- Remove 1 day from Arenal or Monteverde to add Osa.  \n\n---\n\n### **FINAL RECOMMENDATION**  \n- **Stick to 12 days** if you prefer a relaxed pace.  \n- **Extend to 14-16 days** for Osa\u2019s wild, untouched beauty (worth it if you love wildlife!).  \n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like me to adjust the itinerary to include Osa, or if you have other tweaks in mind. *Pura vida!* \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udc12  \n\n*(And seriously \u2013 pack waterproof everything.
