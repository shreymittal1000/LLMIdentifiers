Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of your questions:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Study Abroad & Cross-Cultural Programs**  \nAsbury\u2019s global programs are designed to combine academic rigor, cultural immersion, and faith integration. Here\u2019s how they work:  \n\n#### **Courses & Credits**  \n- **Semester Programs**:  \n  - **Guatemala (CCCU Latin American Studies Program)**: Students take Spanish language courses (all levels), Latin American history/theology, and electives (e.g., social justice, environmental science). Credits transfer directly.  \n  - **Israel (Jerusalem University College)**: Focuses on biblical studies, archaeology, and Middle Eastern culture. Courses like \"Geography of the Holy Land\" count toward Bible/theology majors.  \n  - **Greece (American College of Thessaloniki)**: Offers courses in ancient history, philosophy, and Orthodox Christian studies, alongside modern Greek language.  \n- **Short-Term Trips**: Faculty-led trips (2\u20133 weeks) during breaks, often tied to specific courses (e.g., nursing students serving in clinics, theatre groups performing overseas).  \n\n#### **Cultural Immersion & Service**  \n- **Homestays**: In Guatemala, students live with local families to practice Spanish and engage in community life.  \n- **Service-Learning**: Partnerships with NGOs, churches, and schools. Example: Education majors teach English in rural Greece; social work students assist refugee organizations in Israel.  \n- **Faith Integration**: Programs include worship with local congregations, visits to historic Christian sites (e.g., the Jesus Trail in Israel), and reflections on global mission.  \n\n#### **Financial Support**  \n- **Asbury Global Grants**: Need- and merit-based scholarships for semester programs (typically $1,000\u2013$3,000).  \n- **External Scholarships**: Staff help students apply for Gilman, Fulbright, or denominational mission grants.  \n- **Tuition Parity**: Semester abroad costs align with Asbury\u2019s tuition, making it affordable vs. third-party programs.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Kinlaw Library\u2019s Special Collections**  \nThis is a hidden gem for scholars and students! Highlights include:  \n\n#### **Notable Collections**  \n- **Wesleyan-Holiness Archives**: Original letters from John Wesley, Phoebe Palmer, and other revival leaders; rare 19th-century Methodist hymnals.  \n- **Revival Movement Materials**: Eyewitness accounts of the 1905 Asbury Revival and the 1970 \"Jesus Movement.\"  \n- **Oral Histories**: Recordings of Asbury alumni in global ministry (e.g., missionaries in post-Soviet states).  \n\n#### **Access & Research**  \n- **Open to**: Students, faculty, and external scholars (by appointment).  \n- **Student Projects**: History/theology majors often use primary sources for senior theses. Example: A 2023 student curated an exhibit on Asbury\u2019s role in the Holiness Movement.  \n- **Digital Exhibits**: Selected materials are online, like the *Asbury Revival Timeline* and *Wesleyan Sermon Archive*.  \n\n#### **Heritage Events**  \n- The library hosts annual lectures (e.g., the *Kinlaw Lecture Series*) featuring scholars on Wesleyan theology.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Admissions\u2019 Personal Touch**  \nA quick fun fact: Asbury\u2019s admissions team keeps a **\"prayer wall\"** with notes about prospective students\u2019 needs\u2014so your handwritten note might come with a prayed-over stamp!  \n\n---\n\n### **Follow-Up Questions?**  \nFor study abroad: Would you like details on faculty leaders or alumni stories?  \nFor the archives: Interested in how freshmen can engage with special collections?  \nOr anything else!"

They design syllabi to align with Asbury\u2019s curriculum.  \n- **Local Partners**: In Greece, students learn archaeology from professors at the **American College of Thessaloniki**; in Guatemala, indigenous educators teach Mayan culture.  \n- **Mentorship**: Faculty emphasize *reflective learning*\u2014e.g., journaling about service experiences or leading debriefs at historic sites like Capernaum.  \n\n#### **Notable Alumni Stories**  \n- **Missions & NGO Work**:  \n  - *Jessica (\u201918)*: After Guatemala, she joined *Peace Corps* and now directs a literacy nonprofit in Honduras.  \n  - *Daniel (\u201920)*: Israel program inspired his M.A. in Middle Eastern Studies; he now works with refugee resettlement.  \n- **Academia**:  \n  - *Emily (\u201916)*: Used Greece research for her Ph.D. in Classical Archaeology; now a professor at Wheaton.  \n- **Ministry**: Many alumni credit cross-cultural trips with shaping their calling\u2014e.g., *Mark (\u201922)* pastors a multicultural church in Atlanta.  \n\n---\n\n### **Kinlaw Library: Freshman Engagement**  \nAsbury intentionally integrates special collections into the freshman experience:  \n1. **First-Year Seminars**:  \n   - Courses like *\"Wesley & the Holiness Tradition\"* include a **\"Archives Lab\"** where students handle 19th-century revival pamphlets or letters.  \n2. **Workshops & Tours**:  \n   - Librarians host *\"Discover Kinlaw\"* sessions (with pizza!) to teach archival research basics.  \n3. **Student Worker Opportunities**:  \n   - Freshmen can apply to assist with digitization projects (e.g., scanning oral history tapes) or curate pop-up exhibits (recent: *\"Revival in the Digital Age\"*).  \n4. **Faculty Collaboration**:  \n   - Example: A biology professor partnered with freshmen to study *Asbury\u2019s 1970 revival* through sociological data in the archives.  \n\n**Pro Tip**: The library\u2019s *\"Adopt-a-Document\"* program lets students \"care for\" a rare item (e.g., a Wesley sermon) for a semester\u2014great for r\u00e9sum\u00e9s!  \n\n---\n\n### **Admissions\u2019 Prayer Wall: A Closer Look**  \n- Each week, staff add **prayer requests** from prospective students (e.g., \"nervous about finances\" or \"discerning my major\").  \n- They often mail handwritten verses (like Jeremiah 29:11) with acceptance packets.  \n- *Fun story*: A 2023 student received a note saying, *\"We\u2019ve been praying for you since your first email!\"*\u2014she later chose Asbury over Ivy League schools.  \n\n---\n\n### **Want to Explore Further?**  \n- Study abroad: Should I share specific syllabi or service partnerships?  \n- Library: Interested in how oral histories are recorded?  \n- Admissions: Details about their \"Discernment Retreats\" for undecided students?  \n\nJust ask\u2014I\u2019m all in!"
