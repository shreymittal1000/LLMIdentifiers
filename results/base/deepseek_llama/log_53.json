Here\u2019s a quick guide to help you plan your first trip:\n\n### \ud83c\udf38 **Best Time to Visit**  \n- **Spring (March\u2013May)**: Ideal for cherry blossoms (*sakura*), especially late March to early April. Mild weather but crowded.  \n- **Autumn (October\u2013November)**: Stunning fall foliage, comfortable temps, and fewer crowds than spring.  \n- **Winter (December\u2013February)**: Great for skiing (Hokkaido), hot springs, and illuminations (but cold!).  \n- **Summer (June\u2013September)**: Hot/humid, but lively festivals (e.g., Gion Matsuri in Kyoto). Avoid rainy season (June\u2013July).  \n\n### \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **Must-See Places**  \n1. **Tokyo**: Modern meets traditional. Don\u2019t miss:  \n   - Shibuya Crossing, Shinjuku, Akihabara (for anime/tech).  \n   - Asakusa\u2019s Senso-ji Temple and Meiji Shrine.  \n   - Day trip to Nikko or Hakone (hot springs + Mt. Fuji views).  \n\n2. **Kyoto**: Heart of traditional Japan. Highlights:  \n   - Fushimi Inari Shrine (famous torii gates).  \n   - Arashiyama Bamboo Forest & Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion).  \n   - Gion district (geisha spotting).  \n\n3. **Osaka**: Foodie heaven! Try takoyaki, okonomiyaki, and Dotonbori\u2019s neon lights.  \n\n4. **Hiroshima**: Peace Memorial Park & Miyajima Island (floating torii gate).  \n\n5. **Nara**: Friendly deer and Todai-ji Temple\u2019s giant Buddha.  \n\n### \ud83c\udf5c **Food to Try**  \n- **Ramen** (Tokyo: shoyu, Kyushu: tonkotsu).  \n- **Sushi** (Tsukiji Outer Market or conveyor-belt *kaiten-zushi*).  \n- **Street food**: Taiyaki (fish-shaped cake), yakitori, matcha treats.  \n- **Kaiseki** (fancy multi-course meal in Kyoto).  \n\n### \ud83d\udca1 **Tips for First-Timers**  \n- **Transport**: Get a **JR Pass** (if traveling between cities) + IC card (Suica/Pasmo) for local transit.  \n- **Etiquette**: Bow slightly, don\u2019t tip, and learn basic phrases (*arigato*, *sumimasen*).  \n- **Cash**: Many places still use cash (especially rural areas).  \n- **Convenience Stores**: *7-Eleven/Lawsons* are lifesavers for snacks/ATM.  \n\n### \ud83c\udf8c **Unique Experiences**  \n- Stay in a **ryokan** (traditional inn with tatami floors).  \n- Try an **onsen** (hot spring)\u2014follow the rules (no tattoos? Check ahead!).  \n- Visit a **cat caf\u00e9** or **teamLab Planets** (digital art museum in Tokyo).  \n\nWould you like recommendations for off-the-beaten-path spots or help with an itinerary?
