Both destinations sound fascinating, but I think I'd like to prioritize **Kanazawa** for its samurai districts, gold-leaf crafts, and beautiful gardens. Could you please reorganize the itinerary to include a 2-3 day trip to Kanazawa, substituting it for Osaka/Hiroshima?\n\nAdditionally, I'd love to focus more on **foodie experiences**, such as a **sushi-making class** or a **kaiseki dinner** at a high-end restaurant. Could you suggest some options for these experiences in Tokyo, Kyoto, or Kanazawa?\n\nLastly, I'm interested in exploring more **onsen/ryokan** options, especially those with private onsens. Could you recommend some alternate ryokans that fit my budget and preferences?\n\nThank you again for your incredible help and expertise. I feel like I'm in good hands, and I know that my trip to Japan is going to be an unforgettable adventure! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\ud83d\udc95\n\nP.S. I've got one more question: What's the best way to **learn some basic Japanese phrases** before my trip? Are there any apps, language courses, or resources that you'd recommend? \ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udcac"
