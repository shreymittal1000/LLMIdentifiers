Here\u2019s a quick guide to help you plan your first trip:\n\n### \ud83c\udf38 **Best Time to Visit**  \n- **Spring (March\u2013May):** Famous for cherry blossoms (*sakura*), especially in late March to early April. Mild weather, but crowded.  \n- **Autumn (October\u2013November):** Stunning fall foliage, pleasant temperatures, and fewer crowds than spring.  \n- **Winter (December\u2013February):** Great for skiing (Hokkaido), onsens, and illuminations. Cities like Tokyo and Kyoto are less crowded.  \n- **Summer (June\u2013September):** Hot and humid, but lively with festivals (e.g., Gion Matsuri in Kyoto). Avoid late June\u2013July (rainy season).\n\n### \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **Must-See Places**  \n1. **Tokyo:** Modern meets traditional. Highlights: Shibuya Crossing, Senso-ji Temple, Akihabara (for anime/tech), and Tsukiji Outer Market for sushi.  \n2. **Kyoto:** Cultural heart with temples, tea houses, and geisha districts. Don\u2019t miss Fushimi Inari Shrine, Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion), and Arashiyama\u2019s bamboo forest.  \n3. **Osaka:** Foodie paradise (try takoyaki and okonomiyaki!) and home to Universal Studios Japan.  \n4. **Hiroshima:** Peace Memorial Park and nearby Miyajima Island (floating torii gate).  \n5. **Nara:** Friendly deer and Todai-ji Temple (giant Buddha statue).  \n\n### \u2728 **Tips for First-Timers**  \n- **Transport:** Get a **JR Pass** *only* if traveling cross-country (e.g., Tokyo to Kyoto); otherwise, use IC cards (Suica/Pasmo) for local transit. Bullet trains (*shinkansen*) are efficient!  \n- **Etiquette:** Bow slightly when greeting, remove shoes in traditional places, and avoid eating while walking.  \n- **Cash:** Smaller shops/restaurants may not accept cards\u2014carry yen.  \n- **Food:** Try ramen, sushi, wagyu beef, matcha treats, and konbini (convenience store) snacks like onigiri!  \n\n### \ud83c\udf5c **Bonus Food Recs**  \n- **Tokyo:** Gyukatsu Motomura (beef cutlet), Ichiran Ramen.  \n- **Kyoto:** Nishiki Market for street food, kaiseki (traditional multi-course meal).  \n\nWould you like recommendations for off-the-beaten-path spots or specific interests (e.g., anime, hikes, onsens)? Happy planning! \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\u2728"
