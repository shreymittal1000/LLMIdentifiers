Round-trip can range $500\u2013$900.  \n- **Accommodation:**  \n  - Budget: Condos/Airbnbs in Kihei or Lahaina ($150\u2013$250/night).  \n  - Splurge: Resorts in Wailea (book via Costco Travel for deals).  \n- **Activities:**  \n  - Free/Cheap: Beach-hopping, hiking Waihee Ridge Trail, sunrise at Haleakal\u0101 (need reservation!).  \n  - Worth the Splurge: Snorkel tour to Molokini ($120/person) or a luau (~$150).  \n\n**Must-Do Experiences:**  \n1. **Haleakal\u0101 Sunrise** (bring layers\u2014it\u2019s cold at 10,000 ft!).  \n2. **Road to Hana** (rent a car, stop at Twin Falls and Pipiwai Trail).  \n3. **Snorkeling at Honolua Bay** (turtles!) or a boat tour to Molokini.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83c\udf4b Amalfi Coast, Italy**  \n**Best Time to Visit:**  \n- **May or September:** Perfect weather, fewer crowds, and lower prices than peak summer.  \n- Avoid July/August (hot, packed, expensive).  \n\n**Budget Tips:**  \n- **Flights:** Fly into Naples (cheaper than Rome), then take a train/bus (~$600\u2013$1,000 RT from the U.S.).  \n- **Accommodation:**  \n  - Budget: Stay in **Sorrento** or **Praiano** (less touristy, $150\u2013$300/night).  \n  - Splurge: Boutique B&Bs in Positano (book early!).  \n- **Transport:** Use ferries between towns (cheaper than private drivers).  \n\n**Must-Do Experiences:**  \n1. **Path of the Gods Hike** (breathtaking coastal views).  \n2. **Boat Day to Capri** (swim in the Blue Grotto).  \n3. **Eat ALL the Food:** Lemon granita, fresh seafood, and handmade pasta.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83c\udf0b Azores, Portugal (Bonus!)**  \n**Why It\u2019s Unique:** A volcanic archipelago in the Atlantic with lush landscapes, thermal springs, and whale-rich waters\u2014like Hawaii meets Iceland!  \n\n**Best Time to Visit:** **June\u2013Sept** (warmest) or **April\u2013May** (for flowers).  \n\n**Budget:**  \n- **Flights:** Often under $800 RT from the East Coast (Azores Airlines).  \n- **Accommodation:** Guesthouses or eco-lodges (~$100\u2013$200/night).  \n\n**Must-Do:**  \n1. **Furnas Hot Springs** (bathe in geothermal pools).  \n2. **Sete Cidades** (hike around twin volcanic lakes).  \n3. **Whale Watching** (one of the world\u2019s best spots!).  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**  \n- **Choose Maui** if you want: Tropical ease, epic snorkeling, and a mix of adventure/relaxation.  \n- **Choose Amalfi** if you crave: Romantic charm, coastal hikes, and Italian culture/food.  \n- **Choose Azores** if you love: Off-the-radar nature, volcanoes, and fewer tourists.  \n\nFor your budget, both Maui and Amalfi are doable if you prioritize shoulder seasons and book early! Let me know if you\u2019d like sample itineraries for any of these. \ud83d\ude0a  \n\n**P.S.** If you pick the Azores, I\u2019ll send you a secret recipe for *Cozido das Furnas* (a stew cooked underground by volcanoes!). \ud83c\udf0b\ud83c\udf72"

The idea of watching the sunrise at Haleakal\u0101 and snorkeling in Molokini Crater is just too tempting! \ud83c\udf05\ud83d\udc20 But, at the same time, the Amalfi Coast's romantic charm and coastal hikes are calling my name. \ud83c\udf4b\ud83d\udc63\n\nThe Azores, though, is a dark horse in this race! \ud83c\udf0b I had no idea it was such a unique and fascinating destination.
