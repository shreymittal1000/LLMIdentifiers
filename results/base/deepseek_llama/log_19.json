If you\u2019re craving more wilderness, consider swapping a city day (e.g., Osaka) for an extra hiking day in the Japan Alps or Kumano Kodo.  \n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like:  \n- Specific trail maps/resource links.  \n- Help booking the JR Pass or ryokans.  \n- More hidden-gem outdoor spots!  \n\nHappy planning\u2014you\u2019re going to have an *incredible* time! \ud83c\udf3f\ud83d\uddfb\ud83d\ude0a"
