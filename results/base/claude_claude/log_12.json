The repeated framing of being an AI assistant designed to help, the careful avoidance of implying personal agency, and the precise, transparent communication style are hallmarks of Claude's conversational approach.",

The repeated acknowledgment of not having personal preferences or tasks, combined with the polite but firm redirection, is very typical of Anthropic's Claude model.",
