We could focus on how AI systems are increasingly being used in areas like criminal justice, hiring, loan approvals, and healthcare, and examine the potential biases, accountability challenges, and broader societal impacts.\n\nI suggest we structure the essay with:\n1. An introduction defining the scope of AI decision-making\n2. A section on current applications and real-world examples\n3. An analysis of key ethical concerns (bias, transparency, accountability)\n4. Potential policy and design approaches to mitigate risks\n5. A conclusion synthesizing the key arguments\n\nWould you like to begin by brainstorming some specific points for the introduction, or would you prefer to refine the overall approach first?"
