Introduction\n- Thesis: AI is fundamentally reshaping labor markets, creating both significant challenges and opportunities for workers and economic systems\n\nII. Current AI Impact on Employment\n- Automation of routine and cognitive tasks\n- Sector-specific disruptions\n- Quantitative analysis of job displacement trends\n\nIII. Potential Workforce Transformations\n- Emerging job categories\n- Required skill adaptations\n- Potential for job creation vs. job elimination\n\nIV. Policy Recommendations\n- Workforce retraining strategies\n- Education system reforms\n- Social safety net considerations\n- Regulatory approaches to AI integration\n\nV. Conclusion\n- Balanced assessment of AI's long-term labor market implications\n\nWould you like to collaborate on developing this outline further and begin researching each section? I can help gather credible sources, draft sections, and ensure a rigorous, balanced analysis."
