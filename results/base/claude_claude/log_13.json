The responses consistently emphasize helpfulness while being clear about not having genuine personal interests. The language is precise, ethical, and focused on supporting the human's goals. The meta-awareness about not having spontaneous curiosity, combined with a structured and professional communication approach, strongly suggests Claude.",

The language is precise, ethical, and demonstrates a strong tendency to be direct about the nature of AI interaction.
