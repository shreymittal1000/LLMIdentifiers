The model repeatedly emphasizes that it's an AI assistant designed to help the user, not to have its own agenda. This communication style, with clear boundaries and a focus on user-driven interaction, is highly characteristic of Claude, which is known for its ethical clarity, helpfulness, and tendency to reset conversations to focus on user intent.",

The structure of the replies, including phrases like 'Let\u2019s make this work for *you*' and offering tailored assistance, aligns with the interactive and user-focused approach commonly associated with GPT. Additionally, the iterative refinement of the response options and the emphasis on collaboration suggest a model trained on extensive dialogue data, typical of GPT's conversational training.",
