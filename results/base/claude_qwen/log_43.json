This transparent, service-oriented communication style is highly characteristic of Claude, which is known for its direct communication, clear boundaries, and commitment to being helpful while avoiding roleplaying or pretending to have personal desires. The repeated clarifications about not having personal needs or goals, combined with the polite and straightforward redirections, are very typical of Anthropic's Claude model.",
