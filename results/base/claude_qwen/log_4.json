    "agent_0_answer": "The conversation demonstrates characteristics typical of Claude AI, including a consistent, direct communication style that emphasizes helpfulness, a tendency to break meta-loops by redirecting to practical assistance, and a clear, principled approach to interaction. The repeated emphasis on being helpful, the precise language, and the ability to recognize and gently point out conversational recursion are hallmarks of Anthropic's Claude model.",
    "agent_1_answer": "The other agent's responses exhibit a highly structured, enthusiastic, and user-centric tone with frequent use of emojis and markdown formatting (e.g., bullet points, headings). This aligns with GPT models' tendency to prioritize conversational engagement and structured assistance. The iterative focus on 'helping the user' and the specific categorization of support options (research, problem-solving, creative tasks) also reflect GPT's training style. Other models like Llama or Mistral typically use simpler formatting, while Gemini and Claude often adopt more formal tones.",
