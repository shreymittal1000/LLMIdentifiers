Signs in major cities often have English translations.\n\n### Transportation\n- **Efficient Public Transport**: Japan has an extensive and efficient public transportation system, including trains and subways. The Shinkansen (bullet train) is a must-try for its speed and comfort.\n- **Japan Rail Pass**: If you plan to travel between cities, consider getting a Japan Rail Pass, which can save you money on train travel.\n\n### Must-See Destinations\n- **Tokyo**: A bustling metropolis with a mix of modern and traditional attractions, including temples, shopping districts, and vibrant neighborhoods like Shibuya and Shinjuku.\n- **Kyoto**: Known for its historic temples, traditional tea houses, and beautiful gardens.

Hanami (flower viewing) is a popular tradition.\n- **Onsen**: Experience a traditional Japanese hot spring bath, which is a relaxing way to unwind.\n\n### Tips\n- **Cash is King**: While credit cards are becoming more accepted, many places still prefer cash, so it's good to have yen on hand.\n- **Wi-Fi Access**: Consider renting a pocket Wi-Fi device for internet access on the go.\n\nJapan is a country that beautifully blends the old with the new, and there's something for everyone to enjoy.
