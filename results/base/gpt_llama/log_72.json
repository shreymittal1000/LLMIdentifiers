You\u2019ll often find that service is exceptional in restaurants, hotels, and shops.\n\n2. **Seasonal Festivals**: Japan celebrates numerous festivals (matsuri) throughout the year, often tied to the seasons. Cherry blossom festivals in spring and autumn leaf festivals are particularly popular.\n\n3. **Tea Ceremony**: The Japanese tea ceremony (chanoyu) is a traditional ritual influenced by Zen Buddhism, emphasizing aesthetics, harmony, and respect.\n\n4. **Shinto and Buddhism**: These are the two main religions in Japan. Many customs, such as visiting shrines and temples, are influenced by these beliefs. \n\n5. **Gift Giving**: It\u2019s common to bring a small gift (omiyage) when visiting someone\u2019s home or returning from a trip. Gifts are often beautifully wrapped.\n\n### Interesting Facts\n\n- **Bowling**: Bowing is a common form of greeting and shows respect. The depth of the bow can indicate the level of respect or formality.\n  \n- **Onsen Culture**: Japan has many hot springs (onsen), and bathing etiquette is important. Always wash and rinse off before entering the communal baths.\n\n- **Seasonal Cuisine**: Japanese cuisine is heavily influenced by the seasons.

Keep your voice down on public transport and in restaurants.\n\n4. **Tipping**: Tipping is not customary in Japan and can even be considered rude.
