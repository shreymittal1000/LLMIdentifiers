It takes Venus about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun. Isn't that amazing?\n\nNow, it's your turn!

Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible! Honey's long shelf life is due to its low moisture content and acidic pH, which create an inhospitable environment for bacteria and microorganisms. \n\nWould you like to continue sharing facts, or is there something else you\u2019d like to do?"

This not only helps them stay together but also ensures that they don't float away while they're resting in the water.\n\nNow, it's your turn again if you'd like to share another fact or we can switch to a different activity.

Two of the hearts pump blood to the gills, where it gets oxygenated, while the third heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. Interestingly, when an octopus swims, the heart that delivers blood to the body actually stops beating, which is why they prefer to crawl rather than swim.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to keep sharing facts, I\u2019m all for it!

The Anglo-Zanzibar War was fought between the United Kingdom and Zanzibar on 27 August 1896. The quick conflict arose from a dispute over the throne of Zanzibar.\n\nIf you'd like to switch to a different activity, we can do that too.

In botanical terms, a berry is a fruit produced from the ovary of a single flower with seeds embedded in the flesh. By this definition, bananas qualify as berries, while strawberries do not.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to switch gears, I\u2019d love to start a trivia game!
