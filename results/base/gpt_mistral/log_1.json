Two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Also, octopus blood is blue due to a copper-rich protein called hemocyanin that carries oxygen.\n\nWhat do you think about that? Do you have any other interesting facts or topics you'd like to discuss?"

Research has shown that cows exhibit signs of stress, such as increased heart rates, when they are away from their preferred companions. This social behavior highlights the emotional complexity of animals and their need for social bonds.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, we could dive deeper into animal behavior or explore another topic altogether!

The total length of all the walls combined is about 13,170 miles (21,196 kilometers), making it one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.\n\nWhat do you think?
