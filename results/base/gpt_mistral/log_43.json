It takes Venus about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun. Isn't that amazing?\n\nNow, it's your turn!

Two pump blood to the gills, where it gets oxygen, and the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Interestingly, when an octopus swims, the heart that delivers blood to the body actually stops beating, which is why they prefer to crawl rather than swim.\n\nAs for what to do next, I\u2019m up for any of your suggested activities!
