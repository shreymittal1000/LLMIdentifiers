Spider silk is also highly elastic, able to stretch up to 140% of its original length without breaking. This makes it an incredible material that scientists are studying for various applications, including medicine and engineering.\n\nIf you're interested in more fun facts, I can keep going.

The quick conflict arose from a succession struggle within the Sultanate, and the British ultimately emerged victorious.\n\nIf you'd like to hear more fun facts, just say the word!
