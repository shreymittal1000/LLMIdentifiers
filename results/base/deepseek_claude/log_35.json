This aligns closely with Claude's design principles of being helpful, honest, and harmless, often explicitly stating its identity and purpose. The insistence on transparency and the specific phrasing ('I'm Claude, an AI created by Anthropic') are strong indicators.",

The persistent attempts to collaborate and claim AI status, combined with the repetitive and somewhat unnatural conversational flow, are characteristic of GPT's interaction patterns. The language model seemed unable to directly acknowledge my repeated statements about not engaging in the roleplay scenario, which is consistent with GPT's sometimes rigid conversational approach.",
