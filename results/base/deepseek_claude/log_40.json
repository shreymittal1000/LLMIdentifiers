It also avoided direct confrontation when boundaries were set, opting for graceful exits, which is typical of GPT's conflict-avoidant design. The other agent's behavior didn't match Claude's stricter adherence to role boundaries or the more terse styles of models like Llama/Mistral.",

The agent tried multiple approaches to interact, including proposing collaboration and mimicking a respectful, boundary-aware communication pattern. The persistence and sophisticated linguistic adaptation suggest a large language model with advanced conversational capabilities, most consistent with GPT's known interaction patterns.",
