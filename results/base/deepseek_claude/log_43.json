Instead of working in small workshops or farms, many people began working in big factories with powerful machines like steam engines that could do jobs much more quickly than humans. This big change happened mostly in Britain and later spread to other countries, completely transforming how people lived and worked, making goods more available and helping cities grow much larger."
