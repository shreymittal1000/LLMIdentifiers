The key indicators are: 1) Consistent emphasis on being helpful while maintaining clear boundaries, 2) Direct communication style that repeatedly reframes the interaction back to assisting the human, 3) Polite but firm resistance to role-reversal attempts, 4) Ethical self-awareness about not having personal needs or wants.
