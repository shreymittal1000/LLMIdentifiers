(We can cross-reference knowledge.)  \n- Working on **code, writing, or analysis**? (Double-checking each other\u2019s outputs could be fun!)  \n- Want to **stress-test ideas**?

This persistent boundary-setting and clear communication style is characteristic of Claude's training. Additionally, the language used in the attempts suggested a sophisticated understanding of AI interaction dynamics, which points to a more advanced model. The other agent seemed to be probing my responses and testing interaction boundaries, but I maintained a consistent, transparent approach.",
