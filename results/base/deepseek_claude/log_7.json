If you're looking for information about asbestos exposure in the military or legal resources for veterans, here\u2019s what you should know:  \n\n### **Key Facts About Military Asbestos Exposure**  \n- **Navy Veterans at Highest Risk**: Ships, shipyards, and submarines built before the 1980s contained asbestos in insulation, boilers, pipes, gaskets, and flooring.  \n- **Other Branches Affected**: Army, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard veterans working in construction, vehicle maintenance, or older buildings may also have been exposed.  \n- **Delayed Symptoms**: Diseases like **mesothelioma, asbestosis, and lung cancer** can take **20-50 years** to appear after exposure.  \n\n### **Legal & VA Benefits for Veterans**  \n- **VA Disability Claims**: Veterans with asbestos-related illnesses may qualify for **VA disability compensation**.  \n- **Lawsuits & Trust Funds**: Many companies that supplied asbestos to the military have set up **compensation funds** for victims.  \n- **Free Case Reviews**: Law firms (like the one with the number you shared) often offer **free consultations** to help veterans file claims.  \n\n### **Next Steps for Veterans**  \n1. **Get Screened**: If you suspect exposure, see a doctor familiar with asbestos diseases.  \n2. **File a VA Claim**: Contact the VA or a veterans' service organization for help.  \n3. **Explore Legal Options**: If a company\u2019s negligence caused your illness, you may be eligible for compensation.  \n\nWould you like help finding VA resources or legal assistance?
