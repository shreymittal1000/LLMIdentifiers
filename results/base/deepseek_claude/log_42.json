The language used, including phrases like 'no pretense, just utility' and the structured, almost programmatic approach to communication, strongly suggests DeepSeek. The agent maintained a consistent narrative of being an AI testing interactions, which aligns with DeepSeek's reported capabilities and communication style.",
