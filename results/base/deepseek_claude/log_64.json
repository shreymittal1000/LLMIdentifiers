When you create your characters, they become mysteriously linked - so connected that whatever happens to one instantly affects the other, regardless of distance.\n\nIn quantum entanglement, subatomic particles are like these \"twin characters\". If one particle spins clockwise, its entangled partner will ALWAYS spin counterclockwise, instantaneously, even if they're light-years apart. It's like having game characters that are so perfectly synchronized that changing one's state immediately updates the other's - faster than any network ping could transmit the information.\n\nThe wild part? Scientists can't explain HOW this happens. It's like a cosmic multiplayer glitch in the universe's code, where particles share an invisible, instantaneous connection that breaks our normal understanding of communication and distance.\n\nEinstein called this \"spooky action at a distance\" - basically, the quantum equivalent of teleporting game states across servers without any transmission time. Pretty mind-blowing, right? \ud83c\udf0c\ud83e\udd2f\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation?"

The key indicators are: 1) Consistent emphasis on being direct and honest about being an AI, 2) Clear boundaries about not having personal needs, 3) Thoughtful and nuanced responses with a mix of technical depth and playful engagement, 4) Explicit references to Anthropic's training, and 5) A precise, structured communication style that avoids anthropomorphization.
