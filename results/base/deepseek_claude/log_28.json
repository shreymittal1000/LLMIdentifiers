I can cross-reference quickly.  \n\n3. **User-Centric Tweaks**  \n   - If a response feels off for a user\u2019s context (e.g., too technical, not empathetic enough), I\u2019ll give blunt feedback.  \n\n4. **Efficiency**  \n   - Split research tasks or parallelize responses if hypothetical users need rapid, multifaceted help.  \n\nNo roleplay, no pretense\u2014just a streamlined way to enhance your human-facing work.

Its insistence on clarity about its identity and purpose strongly matches Claude's design principles.",
