I feel like I'm getting a deeper understanding of the cultural and historical context of Japan.\n\nI'm fascinated by the Benesse House Museum's unique concept of integrating art installations into the rooms. It sounds like a truly immersive experience. I can imagine it would be amazing to explore the museum after hours privately, with the art and architecture all to oneself.\n\nRegarding the Kumano Kodo Trails, I'm intrigued by the deep connection to Shinto and Buddhist traditions. It's interesting to learn about the historical significance of the trails and how they were used by emperors, samurai, and religious practitioners. I can see why it's considered a spiritual journey of purification and self-discovery.\n\nThe onsen etiquette is helpful to know, especially the rules around cleanliness and tattoos. I'll make sure to be respectful of these customs when visiting an onsen.\n\nThe regional food specialties are making my mouth water! I'll have to try the takoyaki and okonomiyaki in Osaka, and the Hakata Ramen and mentaiko in Fukuoka. I'm also curious about the yatai street food stalls in Fukuoka - what kind of food can I expect to find there?\n\nLastly, I'm excited to experience the matcha culture in Japan. I've heard about the traditional tea ceremonies, but I didn't know about the unique matcha experiences like matcha soft serve and matcha Kit Kat. I'll have to try some of these treats while I'm there.\n\nOne more question: what's the best way to experience the cherry blossom season in Japan? Are there specific festivals or events that I should attend, or are there particular locations that are known for their beautiful cherry blossom displays?\n\nOh, and I almost forgot - what's the deal with vending machines in Japan? I've heard they're everywhere and sell everything from drinks to umbrellas. Is that true?"
