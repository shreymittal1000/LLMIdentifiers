I feel like I have a much better understanding of what to expect and how to make the most of my time in Japan.\n\nI'm particularly excited about visiting the Chichu Art Museum and experiencing the unique blend of art and architecture. The permanent installations by James Turrell, Walter De Maria, and Claude Monet sound incredible, and I appreciate the tip about the museum's design interacting with natural light.\n\nFor the Kumano Kodo Trails, I think I'll definitely try the Nakahechi Route, specifically the section from Takijiri to Takahara. The scenic views and relatively short distance sound perfect for a beginner like me.\n\nRegarding the Japan Rail Pass, I'm glad to hear that there are no blackout dates and that I can use it on most JR trains. I'll make sure to make seat reservations in advance during peak seasons, as you suggested.\n\nThe restaurant recommendations are also much appreciated. I'll definitely try to visit Sapporo Ramen Yokocho and Uni Murakami in Hokkaido, and Hyotei and Nishiki Market in Kyoto. I'm also intrigued by the idea of trying lamb BBQ at Jingisukan Daruma and watching the theatrical omelette cooking at Kichi Kichi Omurice.\n\nAs for experiencing local culture, I think I'll try to attend the Gion Matsuri in Kyoto, as it sounds like an incredible festival. I'll also make sure to participate in a tea ceremony, stay in a traditional ryokan, and try onsen bathing. Taking a cooking class and visiting local markets also sound like great ways to immerse myself in the local culture.\n\nFinally, I appreciate the tips for interacting with locals. I'll definitely make an effort to learn basic Japanese phrases, be respectful and polite, and show interest in local customs. I'll also try to use non-verbal communication, such as bowing, and be patient and humble.\n\nOne last question: what's the best way to get around Japan's cities, aside from using the Japan Rail Pass for inter-city travel? Are there any specific subway or bus systems that I should use, or are taxis a good option? And are there any bike-sharing or walking tours that I can take to explore the cities?"
