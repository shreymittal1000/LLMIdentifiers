I feel like I have a much better understanding of what to expect from a ryokan experience, a traditional tea ceremony, and the cherry blossom season.\n\nI'd like to ask a few follow-up questions to clarify some points. Regarding the ryokan experience, you mentioned that guests typically sleep on futons. Are the futons comfortable, and are they suitable for people with back problems or other mobility issues?
