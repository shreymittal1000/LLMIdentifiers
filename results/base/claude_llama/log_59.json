I feel like I have a much better understanding of the Japan Rail Pass, recommended apps, Suica/Pasmo IC cards, and Japanese etiquette tips.\n\nI'd like to ask a few more questions to clarify some points. Regarding the Japan Rail Pass, you mentioned that it's cost-effective for extensive travel between cities. Can you give me an estimate of how much I can save with the pass compared to buying individual train tickets? For example, if I plan to travel from Tokyo to Kyoto, Kyoto to Hiroshima, and Hiroshima back to Tokyo, how much would the individual train tickets cost versus the Japan Rail Pass?\n\nAlso, I'm interested in learning more about the cultural guides you recommended. Can you tell me more about the Japan Official Travel App and the Japan Guide app? What kind of information do they provide, and are they available in multiple languages?\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to ask about the Suica/Pasmo IC cards. You mentioned that they can be recharged at stations and convenience stores. Can I also recharge them at airports, and are there any fees associated with recharging or using the cards?\n\nLastly, I appreciate the etiquette tips you provided. I'd like to ask about gift-giving in Japan. I've heard that it's a significant custom, especially when visiting someone's home. What are some appropriate gifts to bring, and are there any specific rules or customs I should follow when giving gifts?\n\nOh, and one more thing! I've heard that Japan has a vibrant festival and event scene, with many unique and fascinating festivals throughout the year. Can you recommend any notable festivals or events that I should consider attending during my trip?"
