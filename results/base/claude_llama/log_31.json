Here's a travel scenario:\n\nMeet Emma, a 30-year-old freelance writer who loves history, architecture, and trying new foods. She's planning a solo trip to Europe in the spring (April-May) and has a budget of around $2,000 for 7-10 days. She's interested in visiting a city with a rich cultural heritage, vibrant atmosphere, and plenty of opportunities to explore historic landmarks, museums, and local markets. She's also a foodie and would love to try authentic, traditional cuisine.\n\nEmma is open to visiting a city she's never been to before, but she's also considering returning to a place she's visited briefly in the past. She's looking for a destination that's relatively safe for a solo female traveler and has a good public transportation system.\n\nWith these preferences in mind, can you suggest some European cities that might be a good fit for Emma's spring trip? What destinations would you recommend, and what are some must-see attractions, experiences, or neighborhoods that she shouldn't miss?"
