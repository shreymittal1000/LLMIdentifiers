I'm fascinated by the city-specific celebrations and the cultural significance of the Cherry Blossom Festival.\n\nThe concept of \"mono no aware\" is particularly intriguing. It's beautiful how the Japanese culture has developed a philosophical framework to appreciate the fleeting nature of life and beauty. The idea that the cherry blossoms' brief blooming period teaches people to appreciate momentary beauty and accept change is profound.\n\nI'd love to explore more about the traditional celebrations in Kyoto. You mentioned that the blossoms frame historic temples and geisha districts, emphasizing cultural elegance. Can you tell me more about the role of geisha in Kyoto's Cherry Blossom Festival celebrations? Are there any specific events or performances that feature geisha, or is it more about the atmospheric presence of these traditional entertainers?\n\nAdditionally, I'm curious about the food and drink associated with the Cherry Blossom Festival. Are there any traditional dishes or beverages that are typically consumed during this time? For example, I've heard of sakura-themed treats like sakura mochi or sakura-flavored drinks. Can you recommend any must-try foods or drinks for someone attending the festival?\n\nLastly, you mentioned purchasing a Japan Rail Pass for easy travel between cities.
