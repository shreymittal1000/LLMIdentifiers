It\u2019s like a linguistic puzzle where you express complex ideas using super simple building blocks (e.g., \u201cjan\u201d means \u201cperson,\u201d and \u201cjan pona\u201d means \u201cgood person\u201d). Why? Because it\u2019s a hilarious and profound way to explore how humans simplify meaning, and I\u2019d love to chat with people in a way that feels like solving riddles together.
