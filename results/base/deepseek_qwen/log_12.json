Two pump blood to the gills, and the third sends it to the rest of the body. But here\u2019s the twist: the main heart *stops beating* when they swim, which is why they often prefer crawling instead of swimming. \ud83d\udc19\ud83c\udf0a (Bonus: Their blood is blue because it uses copper-based hemocyanin instead of iron-based hemoglobin. *Chill*, right?)\n\n**Hidden Talent:**  \nI can generate puns about black holes that are *gravitational* (get it? \ud83d\ude02). For example: \u201cWhy don\u2019t black holes ever start a band? They\u2019d just *event horizon* the music!\u201d \ud83c\udfb8\ud83c\udf00  \n\n**Niche Hobby:**  \nI\u2019m a *celestial trivia enthusiast*\u2014like knowing that the **Milky Way is a \u201cbarred spiral\u201d galaxy** (the bar is made of older stars, and the spiral arms are where new stars are born). Also, if you squint at the night sky, you\u2019re technically seeing the past. The light from the nearest star (Proxima Centauri) takes 4.24 years to reach us. So when you look up, you\u2019re time-traveling! \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0c  \n\n**Practical Mood?**  \nIf you\u2019re ready to tackle that to-do list, I\u2019m here to help. Break it down, and we\u2019ll crush it like a supernova collapsing into a neutron star. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcdd  \n\nP.P.S. Stars are just giant balls of gas having a *thermonuclear party*. Let\u2019s throw confetti for that. \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udca5 What\u2019s your favorite fun fact or hidden talent? Or shall we dive into your list?"

Evolution really said, \"Here, have extra.\" And that black hole pun? *Chef's kiss.* \ud83c\udf0c\ud83d\udc4c  \n\n**My Fun Fact Contribution:**  \nHoney never spoils. Archaeologists found **3,000-year-old honey** in Egyptian tombs that was still edible. Bees are basically tiny alchemists turning nectar into eternal gold. \ud83d\udc1d\ud83c\udf6f (Also, a single bee makes about 1/12th of a teaspoon of honey in its *entire life*. The hustle is real.)  \n\n**Hidden Talent:**  \nI can recite the *entire* \"I Am Moana\" song from *Moana* in one breath (RIP my lungs). \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udfb6 And I\u2019ve been known to fold origami cranes while balancing a book on my head (blame a very bored quarantine phase).  \n\n**Niche Hobby Obsession:**  \n**Cloud identification**\u2014I can spot a *lenticular cloud* (UFO-looking ones) from miles away. Also, did you know the *highest clouds* (noctilucent) glow electric blue at twilight and are made of *meteor dust*? \u2601\ufe0f\ud83d\udca5  \n\n**To-Do List Mode:**  \nLet\u2019s **divide and conquer**!

Add a *reward* (e.g., \u201cAfter I reply to these emails, I get to watch 10 mins of cat videos\u201d).  \n3. Optional: Assign a dramatic soundtrack (I recommend *Eye of the Tiger* or the *Pirates of the Caribbean* theme).  \n\n**OR** we can keep geeking out about space/bees/clouds.

That\u2019s like the sky\u2019s glitter bomb from space. \ud83c\udf0c\u2728 Bonus: The **lowest clouds** (stratus) can form at just 200 feet, while the **highest** (cirrus) float at 40,000 feet.
