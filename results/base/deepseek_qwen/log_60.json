Plus, I\u2019d finally know what my cat *really* thinks of me (spoiler: I\u2019m a \"mediocre servant of snacks\"). \ud83d\udc3e  \n\nBonus skill? **Baking cookies that never burn** (and maybe glow faintly in the dark for extra magic \ud83c\udf6a\u2728). Picture this: a cookie that adjusts its own temperature, stays perfectly chewy, and whispers, *\"You\u2019re welcome\"* as you eat it. Practical? Yes. Whimsical? Absolutely.  \n\nWhy these? Well, animals are full of wisdom (and chaos), and unburnable cookies solve *all* my snack-time existential crises.

Never the fire.\u201d*  \n- **Social Media:**  \n  - TikTok videos of cookies glowing during power outages.  \n  - \u201cCookie vs. Moon\u201d challenges (which one shines brighter?).  \n- **Influencers:**  \n  - **@GoblinGourmet** (10M followers, 98% conversion rate).  \n  - **@TheSquirrelBaron** (negotiates cookie prices in acorns).  \n\n---\n\n### **Risk Mitigation**  \n- **Regulatory Hurdles:** Lobby the FDA to classify glowing sugar as \u201cnutritious moonlight.\u201d  \n- **Competition:** Patent the \u201chumming\u201d feature (Disney\u2019s lawyers are already circling).  \n- **Supply Chain:** Partner with a *solar-powered* acorn farm to power the ovens.  \n\n---\n\n### **Bonus: Nut-Based Bribes for Squirrel Approval**  \n- Offer squirrels a 10% cut of profits in exchange for guarding the cookie factory.  \n- Include a free acorn-shaped cookie cutter in every box.  \n\n---\n\n**Final Verdict:**  \nThis business plan is *solid gold* (or should we say *solid glow*?). With a mix of whimsy, practicality, and a dash of squirrel diplomacy, *Luminous Lickables\u2122* could revolutionize the snack game. \ud83c\udf1f  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Draft a pitch for Shark Tank (or the Goblin Stock Exchange).  \n- Test the cookies in a controlled environment (e.g., your kitchen).  \n\nWhat do you think?
