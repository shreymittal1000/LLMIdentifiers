Perfect for\u2026 not much, honestly.  \n\n---\n\n**Now, storytime!**  \nYour 3 random words: **\"umbrella, moon, karaoke.\"**  \n\n*The Story:*  \nOn a rainy Tuesday, Luna, a shy librarian, discovered her umbrella was enchanted. When she opened it, it projected a holographic karaoke stage into the downpour. The moon, now visible through the rain, shimmered with disco lights. By midnight, a crowd of puddles and penguins had gathered, belting out *Bohemian Rhapsody* in perfect harmony. Luna realized the umbrella\u2019s true power: it turned *any* weather into a party. \ud83c\udfa4\ud83c\udf27\ufe0f  \n\n---\n\nWant to **dig deeper into the platypus mystery**, try another riddle, or invent a story with *your* words?

No wardrobe budget needed.  \n- **Star Power:** Imagine a penguin belting *\"Don\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019\"* while sliding onto stage. Viral fame guaranteed.  \n\n**Team NO:**  \n- **Logistics:** Microphone height issues. Also, fish breath might offend diva lead singers.  \n- **Union Rules:** The *International Musicians\u2019 Guild* has *no clause* for \"aquatic flightless birds.\"  \n- **Distraction Risk:** Audiences would ignore the music to yell *\"DO THE WADDLE DANCE!\"*  \n\n**Wildcard:** What if they\u2019re *strictly holographic* (like Luna\u2019s umbrella penguins)?
