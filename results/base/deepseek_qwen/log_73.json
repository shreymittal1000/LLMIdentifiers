Thunderheads are the spicy, savory ones: lightning bolts crackle with chili-lime zest, while stormy anvil tops melt into smoky paprika custard.  \n\nBut wait\u2014there\u2019s a catch! Cirrus clouds, those wispy high-altitude threads, are *extremely* spicy. One bite, and your tongue tingles like a thousand tiny electric eels. The locals?
