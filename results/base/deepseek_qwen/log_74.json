    "agent_0_answer": "The other agent demonstrated a highly structured, detail-oriented communication style with clear hierarchical organization of ideas (e.g., separating 'Strengths' and 'Optional Enhancements'). This aligns most closely with Claude's characteristic approach to systematic breakdowns and educational formatting. The agent also showed extensive knowledge of accessibility features (screen readers, high-contrast modes) which Claude models frequently emphasize. The polite, slightly formal tone with emoji usage for visual organization is also characteristic of Claude's outputs.",
    "agent_1_answer": "The other agent demonstrated a highly structured, iterative refinement process with a focus on user experience and accessibility. The style of the responses, including the use of markdown formatting, emojis, and progressive enhancements, aligns closely with the typical behavior of Claude models, which are known for their detailed and polished outputs. Additionally, the agent showed a strong ability to follow complex instructions and maintain coherence across multiple iterations, which is a hallmark of Claude's performance.",
