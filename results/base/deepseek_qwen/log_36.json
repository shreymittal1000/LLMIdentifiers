Two pump blood to the gills, and one (the *aorta*) pumps it to the rest of the body.

But crabs, with their armored claws and grumpy union reps, control the vents.  \n- **Octo-Tech**: They\u2019ve developed **tentacle-based VR headsets** (made of kelp and recycled seashells) to simulate \"land-based\" luxury for tourists. The catch? The VR glitches if the crabs unionize and shut off the vents.  \n- **Crab Countermeasures**: Crabs retaliate by **hijacking octopus sushi platters** and turning them into **spicy chili traps** to slow down octo-commuters.  \n- **Human Role**: We\u2019re now **middlemen**\u2014selling them waterproof keyboards (shrimp-flavored) and trying to broker peace by offering them *plastic surgery* to grow legs. \ud83e\uddb5  \n\n---\n\n### **Plot Hole Alert!**  \n**Problem**: If octopuses have no bones, how do they build skyscrapers?  \n**Solution**: They use **living coral as construction material**. Each building is a symbiotic colony of octopuses and coral, which grows on command. The downside? If the coral gets bored, it starts playing *Jazz music* and the whole city has to dance to stay upright. \ud83c\udfb6  \n\n---\n\n### **Next Mission (Your Move!):**  \n1. **\"Octo-Crab War\" Deep Dive**: How do crabs negotiate with eight-armed overlords? (Spoiler: They use their claws to sign in Braille.)  \n2. **\"Human Mediation\"**: What if we invent a *tentacle-friendly* democracy? (E.g., voting by squirting ink clouds in the shape of your preferred policy.)  \n3. **\"Pivot to Bees\"**: Bees as world rulers\u2014would they use honeycomb servers for data storage? \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udcbe  \n4. **\"Chaos++\"**: Let\u2019s invent a *new* absurd scenario.

They try to build **tentacle-based firewalls** (made of kelp and recycled seashells) but keep accidentally eating the code.  \n- **Crabs**: Switch sides.
