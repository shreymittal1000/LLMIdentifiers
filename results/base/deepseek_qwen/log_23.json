Not just for his art (though *The Last Supper* and the *Mona Lisa* are iconic), but because he was a *master of curiosity*\u2014a painter, inventor, scientist, and philosopher. I\u2019d ask him how he balanced so many disciplines, what inspired his flying machines, and if he ever got frustrated with his \u201cunfinished\u201d projects (like the *Sala delle Asse* ceiling). Plus, I\u2019d love to hear his thoughts on creativity in the 21st century!  \n\n**Your turn!** Who would you choose? Or maybe you\u2019d prefer to brainstorm a story or solve a problem?

She was a symbol of reason and education in a city torn apart by conflict, and her tragic death underscores the fragility of intellectual freedom. I\u2019d ask her how she navigated the tension between her role as a public intellectual and the chaos around her, and what she thought of the future of science in a world that often fears it.  \n\nIf you pick Tesla, I\u2019d want to hear about his vision for wireless energy and how he felt about being overshadowed by Edison.
