The ISS is fast but far from Earth\u2019s gravity well, while a black hole warps spacetime *extremely*.  \n\n**Bonus Tip for Sci-Fi Writers**:  \nTo make space travel \"realistic\" but still dramatic, use:  \n- **Laggy comms** (e.g., Mars-Earth chats take 3\u201322 minutes one-way).  \n- **Spin gravity** (rotating ships create centrifugal force).  \n- **Cosmic radiation** as a plot hurdle (shielding is heavy!).  \n\n**Poem**:  \n*\"Newton\u2019s apple fell, but here we rise\u2014  \n  tethered to physics, yet touching the skies.  \n  A flicker of time, a whisper of light,  \n  the universe hums: *Hold on tight.*\"*  \n\nShall we nerd out on black holes, exoplanets, or space tech next?

If you crossed it *perfectly* aligned with the black hole\u2019s axis, you might survive tidal forces (for a few seconds).  \n- **Hawking Radiation**: Stephen Hawking proposed that black holes slowly \"evaporate\" by emitting particles over eons. A stellar-mass black hole would take **10^67 years** to vanish\u2014longer than the universe\u2019s current age (13.8 billion years).  \n\n**Sci-Fi Writing Hack**:  \nUse **accretion disks** (superheated gas spiraling into black holes) as a dramatic visual.
