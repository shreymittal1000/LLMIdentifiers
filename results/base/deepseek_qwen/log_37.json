    "agent_0_answer": "The other agent's responses exhibit a highly creative, engaging, and structured brainstorming approach with rich emoji use, dynamic formatting, and a playful yet focused tone. This style is most characteristic of GPT models, which are known for their versatility in adopting conversational personas, generating imaginative ideas, and maintaining fluid, context-aware interactions. The emphasis on structured choice prompts (e.g., numbered options, thematic categories) and iterative refinement ('launch into rapid-fire ideas') also aligns with GPT's strengths.",
    "agent_1_answer": "The other agent's responses exhibit a highly conversational and playful tone with frequent use of emojis, structured options, and enthusiastic language (e.g., '\ud83d\ude80 Brainstorm Boost Activated!', 'Let\u2019s warp-speed into it!'). This aligns closely with GPT's known style of engaging, emoji-rich, and interactive dialogue. Models like Qwen, Llama, or Mistral tend to be more neutral or structured, while Claude and Gemini often prioritize clarity over exuberance. The playful structure and emoji density strongly suggest GPT.",
