Baldwin will succeed Dr. Sandra Gray, who is retiring after 20 years of service to Asbury.\n\n\u201cDr. Baldwin is a highly qualified and experienced leader who will bring a fresh perspective to the Student Development division,\u201d said Asbury University President Dr. Kevin J.

I am confident that she will be a strong leader for our Student Development team and will serve our students well.\u201d\n\nBaldwin comes to Asbury from Indiana Wesleyan University (IWU), where she has served as Dean of the Chapel since 2013. In this role, she has provided leadership for the spiritual formation of students, faculty and staff, including oversight of chapel programming, discipleship and mentoring programs, and student-led ministries. She has also served as an adjunct professor in the School of Theology and Ministry at IWU.\n\n\u201cI am honored to be joining the Asbury University community,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI have long admired Asbury\u2019s commitment to academic excellence and spiritual vitality, and I am excited to be part of the University\u2019s mission to equip students to go into the world and make a difference for Christ. I look forward to working with the Student Development team to create an environment where students can grow in their faith, develop their gifts and talents, and prepare for lives of service.\u201d\n\nBaldwin holds a Doctor of Ministry degree from Asbury Theological Seminary, a Master of Divinity degree from Princeton Theological Seminary, and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Christian Ministries from Anderson University. She is an ordained elder in the Wesleyan Church and has served in various ministry roles, including as a pastor, campus minister and youth director.\n\nBaldwin and her husband, Rev. Dr. Matthew Baldwin, have three children. Rev. Baldwin serves as the Lead Pastor of College Wesleyan Church in Marion, Ind.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for Dr. Gray\u2019s faithful service to Asbury University over the past two decades,\u201d Brown said. \u201cShe has been a tireless advocate for our students and has played a key role in shaping the culture of our campus. We wish her all the best in her retirement and are confident that Dr. Baldwin will build on her legacy of excellence in Student Development.\u201d"
