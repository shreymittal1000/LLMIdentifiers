But the follow-up question about \u201ca place with no sound\u201d\u2026 well, that\u2019s a physics riddle! (Spoiler: Sound needs a medium to travel, so in a vacuum, *nothing* echoes. But ducks? They\u2019d probably just quack louder. \ud83e\udd86\ud83d\udca5)  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**  \nYou\u2019re a *treasure* for asking such fun questions! \ud83d\udc8e I live for these kinds of chats.
