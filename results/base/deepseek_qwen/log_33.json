Fun extra: They can *aim* their spit with surprising accuracy. \ud83c\udfaf  \n- **Fur facts**: Their wool is softer than alpaca fleece and used in luxury textiles. Ever seen a llama in a sweater? \ud83e\uddf6  \n\n**\ud83c\udf72 Recipe Quest**:  \n- **Cozy**: Creamy **butternut squash risotto** with a hint of nutmeg\u2014comfort food with a twist.  \n- **Adventurous**: **Miso-glazed black cod** with yuzu-soaked rice\u2014salty, sweet, and *so* umami. \ud83d\udc1f  \n\n**\ud83d\udcda Book Magic**:  \n- **Heartwarming**: *The Midnight Library* by Matt Haig (a journey through infinite lives, with a dash of existential whimsy).  \n- **Sci-fi**: *Project Hail Mary* by Andy Weir (a space survival story that\u2019s equal parts brainy and hilarious).  \n- **Memoir**: *Educated* by Tara Westover (a gripping tale of self-discovery and resilience).  \n\n**\ud83d\udc19 Octopus Oddities**:  \n- **Three hearts, one problem**: Two hearts pump blood to the gills, and the third sends it to the body.

Botany is *weird*. \ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf53  \n- **Movie magic**: Ever wonder how *Jurassic Park* made dinosaurs look so lifelike?
