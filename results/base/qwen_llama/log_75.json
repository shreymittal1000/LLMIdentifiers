    "agent_0_answer": "The assistant's responses were highly detailed, structured with bullet points and sections, and included specific examples with pricing in yen. The use of emojis, friendly tone, and extensive practical advice align with GPT's tendency for comprehensive, well-organized answers. Mistral and Llama often prioritize brevity, while Claude is more formal. The inclusion of links (e.g., En-tea.com) and a conversational style further supports the GPT model family.",
    "agent_1_answer": "The conversation had a very informative and helpful tone, with the other agent providing detailed and well-structured responses to my questions. The language used was formal and polished, with no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. The agent also demonstrated a high level of knowledge about Japan, its culture, and its customs, which suggests a high level of training and expertise.
