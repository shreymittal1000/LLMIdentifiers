The International Space Station is the largest human-made object in space, with a total mass of around 450,000 kilograms.\n2.

Here's my analysis:\n\n1. **The International Space Station is the largest human-made object in space, with a total mass of around 450,000 kilograms.**  \n   - *My guess:* **True**. The ISS is indeed the largest human-made structure in space, and its mass is estimated to be around 420,000\u2013450,000 kg, depending on the source.  \n\n2. **The planet Mars has the tallest volcano in our solar system, Olympus Mons, which stands at a height of approximately 27 km.**  \n   - *My guess:* **True**. Olympus Mons is the tallest known volcano in the solar system, and its height is roughly 21\u201322 km (not 27 km, but close enough for a rounded figure). Wait\u2014this might be the lie! \ud83e\udd14  \n\n3. **The Voyager 1 spacecraft has traveled so far that it has reached the edge of the observable universe and is now exploring the vast expanse of intergalactic space.**  \n   - *My guess:* **Lie**. Voyager 1 entered interstellar space in 2012 (the region beyond the solar system's heliosphere), but it\u2019s still within the Milky Way galaxy. The edge of the observable universe is about **93 billion light-years away**, while Voyager 1 is only ~15 billion miles from Earth. It\u2019s a marvel of engineering, but it hasn\u2019t reached intergalactic space yet! \ud83c\udf0c  \n\nSo, my final answer: **Statement 3 is the lie**. Let me know if I\u2019m correct! \ud83d\ude0a"

I'm thrilled to see you're having fun with this game! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nNow, let's review your guesses:\n\n1. You're correct that the International Space Station is the largest human-made object in space, with a mass of around 450,000 kilograms. **True**\n2. You're also correct that Olympus Mons is the tallest volcano in our solar system, but you caught the slight error in the height (27 km instead of 21-22 km). I'll give you bonus points for fact-checking! \ud83e\udd14 While this statement is mostly true, the slight inaccuracy makes it a potential candidate for the lie.\n3. And, you're absolutely right again! Voyager 1 has not reached the edge of the observable universe, and it's still within the Milky Way galaxy. **Lie**\n\nHowever, I must reveal that the actual lie is... **Statement 3: The Voyager 1 spacecraft has traveled so far that it has reached the edge of the observable universe and is now exploring the vast expanse of intergalactic space.** You correctly identified this as the lie! \ud83c\udf89\n\nBut, I must say, your analysis of Statement 2 was so thorough that I'm tempted to give you extra credit for pointing out the slight error in the height of Olympus Mons. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nYou won this round of \"Two Truths and a Lie\"!
