When an octopus swims, the \"main\" heart *stops beating*, which is why they often crawl instead (to avoid exhaustion).  \n- **Blue Blood**: Their blood is copper-based (hemocyanin) instead of iron-based (hemoglobin), making it *royal blue*\u2014ideal for cold, low-oxygen ocean depths.  \n- **Brainy Arms**: Two-thirds of their neurons are in their arms, meaning each arm can \"think\" for itself, tasting and touching independently. Some scientists joke they\u2019re more like \"aliens\" than Earthlings!  \n\n**Bonus Weirdness**: They edit their own RNA to adapt to temperature changes (a superpower humans lack).  \n\nWant to pivot to **historical weirdness** next?

Desperate, they asked the government for help... and the army showed up with *machine guns*.  \n\n**What Happened**:  \n- Soldiers tried to mow down emu flocks, but the birds **outsmarted them**, splitting into small groups and zigzagging at 30 mph (50 km/h). Bullets bounced off their feathers.  \n- After a month, the military gave up, having killed only ~200 emus. The emus celebrated by destroying more crops.  \n- Newspapers dubbed it the **\"Emu War\"**, and the government later implemented *non-violent* solutions (like fences and bounties).  \n\n**Lesson**: Never underestimate birds.  \n\nWant another historical oddity? Or shall we switch gears to space, art, or something else? \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udfa8  \n\n*(P.S. This really happened. Here\u2019s a [photo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/EmuWar1.jpg) of soldiers posing with an emu carcass.)*  \n\nThat\u2019s absolutely wild! The Emu War is one of those historical events that sounds like it\u2019s straight out of a comedy sketch. \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019d love to hear another historical oddity\u2014maybe something involving an unexpected twist or a quirky figure from the past? \ud83c\udfa9\u2728  \n\nPerfect! Let\u2019s talk about the **19th-century dentist who smuggled a queen\u2019s jawbone in a violin case**.  \n\n### **The Bizarre Heist of Queen Caroline\u2019s Jaw**  \nIn 1824, **Queen Caroline of Brunswick** (the estranged wife of King George IV of England) died and was buried in her homeland, Germany. But her vengeful husband *hated* her so much that he demanded proof she was really dead.  \n\n**The Plot Twist**:  \n- A British diplomat hired a **dentist named Dr. Lewis** to sneak into her tomb, *remove her jawbone*, and bring it back to England.  \n- The dentist did it\u2014using a violin case to smuggle the jawbone past guards.  \n- King George reportedly held a macabre dinner party where guests *passed around the jaw* to confirm her identity (by her dental work).  \n\n**Aftermath**: The jawbone was later returned, but the story leaked, causing a scandal. Dentists: the original spies.  \n\n**Why?** Because George IV was paranoid she\u2019d faked her death to humiliate him (their marriage was *that* toxic).  \n\nWant another darkly funny history nugget? Or something lighter? (I\u2019ve got *plenty* of both.) \ud83d\udc80\ud83c\udfbb  \n\n*(Source: *The English and Their History* by Robert Tombs.)*  \n\nThat\u2019s both macabre and hilarious! King George IV really took \u201cholding a grudge\u201d to the next level. \ud83d\ude05 Let\u2019s lighten the mood a bit\u2014do you have a quirky but less grim historical oddity to share? Maybe something involving an eccentric inventor or a bizarre tradition? \ud83c\udfa9\ud83d\udd27  \n\nOh, I\u2019ve got the *perfect* palate cleanser\u2014let\u2019s talk about the **Victorian inventor who built a piano for cats** (and other musical animal antics).  \n\n### **The Exquisite Absurdity of the Cat Piano \ud83c\udfb9\ud83d\udc31**  \nIn 1869, French scientist **Louis-Bertrand Castel** dreamed up the *\"clavecin pour les chats\"* (harpsichord for cats)\u2014a keyboard where each key would *poke a different cat\u2019s tail*, making them yowl in \"musical\" pitches.  \n\n**Why?**  \n- Castel was obsessed with synesthesia (mixing senses, like \"seeing\" sounds) and thought animals could appreciate art too.  \n- He never built it, but the idea spread. German physician **Johann Christian Reil** later suggested using it to *cheer up mentally ill patients* (because nothing says \"therapy\" like tortured cats).  \n\n**Silver Lining**: No evidence it was ever made (thankfully), but it inspired satirical art and even a **modern \"meow\" version** by artist Henry Dagg ([video](https://youtu.be/3jUY7hXs1Ic)).  \n\n**Bonus Quirk**: The *real* 19th-century \"dog piano\" (a barrel organ with trained pups howling along) *did* exist.  \n\nWant more odd inventions? Or pivot to **weird traditions** (like Spain\u2019s *Baby Jumping Festival*)? \ud83c\udfaa\ud83d\udc15  \n\n*(Artistic depiction [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Katzenklavier.jpg).)*  \n\nThat\u2019s delightfully absurd! The cat piano is the kind of idea that makes you wonder what they were thinking. \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019d love to hear about some **weird traditions** next\u2014especially something colorful or festive, like Spain\u2019s Baby Jumping Festival! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udc76  \n\nAhhh, you\u2019re in for a treat\u2014let\u2019s talk about **El Colacho**, the Spanish tradition where men dressed as the *Devil* leap over babies to save their souls.  \n\n### **Spain\u2019s Baby-Jumping Festival (El Colacho) \ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc76**  \nIn the village of **Castrillo de Murcia**, every June (for over 400 years!), the *\"Colacho\"* (a man in a yellow-and-red devil costume) sprints down the street and **vaults over babies born in the past year**\u2014who are laid on mattresses in the road.  \n\n**Why?**  \n- It\u2019s part of **Corpus Christi** celebrations, symbolizing the Devil *jumping out* of the babies\u2019 lives, cleansing them of original sin.  \n- Parents believe it grants their kids protection from evil (and some skip baptism because of it).  \n- The Colacho also whips crowds with a horse-tail wand for \"good luck.\"  \n\n**Safety Note**: No babies have been harmed (it\u2019s more of a *hop* than a hurdle), but the Vatican has called it \"risky.\" Locals DGAF.  \n\n**Bonus Weirdness**: After the jump, the town throws a massive party with *wine-soaked bread* (because Spain).  \n\nWant another global tradition? I\u2019ve got:  \n- **Japan\u2019s Naki Sumo** (sumo wrestlers make babies cry for luck)  \n- **Scotland\u2019s Worm Charming** (luring earthworms with vibrations)  \n- Or something *food-related*? \ud83c\udf5c\ud83c\udfaa  \n\n*(Here\u2019s a [video](https://youtu.be/1J1Mv7XEGtE) of the Colacho in action!)*  \n\nThat\u2019s both thrilling and slightly terrifying! \ud83d\ude05 The Colacho tradition is definitely one of a kind. I\u2019d love to hear about **Japan\u2019s Naki Sumo** next\u2014how do sumo wrestlers make babies cry for luck, and what\u2019s the story behind it? \ud83c\udfef\ud83d\udc76  \n\nGlad you asked! **Naki Sumo** (literally \"Crying Sumo\") is a 400-year-old tradition where sumo wrestlers *compete* to make babies cry the loudest\u2014and it\u2019s as bizarrely wholesome as it sounds.  \n\n### **Japan\u2019s Naki Sumo Festival \ud83c\udfef\ud83d\udc76\ud83d\udca8**  \n**How It Works**:  \n1. Parents bring babies (usually **6 months to 1 year old**) to shrines like the **Sens\u014d-ji Temple in Tokyo**.  \n2. Two sumo wrestlers hold a baby each, and a referee shouts *\"Naki! Naki!\"* (\"Cry! Cry!\").  \n3. The wrestlers make exaggerated faces, bounce the babies, or even *gently pretend to drop them*\u2014all to **elicit the loudest cry**.  \n4. The first baby to wail \"wins,\" and the loudest crier is crowned champion (with a certificate!).  \n\n**Why?**  \n- Belief: A baby\u2019s cry wards off evil spirits and ensures **health and strength**.  \n- It\u2019s also a test of the child\u2019s *vitality*\u2014some parents worry if their baby *doesn\u2019t* cry.  \n- Bonus: The wrestlers\u2019 size contrast makes the scene oddly adorable ([photo](https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9fde0e3b1e0a0c1a1e0a0c1a1e0a0c1a)).  \n\n**Modern Twist**: Some shrines now use *crying competitions* as fundraisers for child welfare.  \n\n**Cultural Deep Cut**: Similar traditions exist in Korea (**Bbang-i Festival**, where elders toss candy to make kids cry) and China (**\"Crying Weddings\"**\u2014brides must sob to prove devotion).  \n\nWant more global baby rituals?
