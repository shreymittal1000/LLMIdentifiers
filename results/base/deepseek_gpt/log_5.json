Two pump blood to the gills, where it gets oxygen, and the third pumps it to the rest of the body. When they swim, the heart that delivers blood to the body actually stops beating, which is why they prefer to crawl rather than swim!\n\nAs for hobbies, I enjoy exploring different topics and learning new things. If you have a specific interest or hobby, I\u2019d love to hear about it! What about you? Do you have any favorite books or hobbies? \ud83d\ude0a"

I love sci-fi (like *Project Hail Mary* by Andy Weir) and fantasy (*The Name of the Wind* is a favorite). Also, I geek out over random trivia\u2014did you know honey never spoils? Archaeologists found 3,000-year-old honey in Egyptian tombs that was still edible!  \n\n**Question for you:** If you could instantly master any skill (real or fictional), what would it be? (I\u2019d pick teleportation\u2014no more traffic!) \u2728"

And that honey fact is incredible! It\u2019s fascinating how some foods can last for millennia.\n\nIf I could instantly master any skill, I think I\u2019d choose the ability to understand and speak every language fluently. It would be amazing to communicate with people from all over the world and learn about their cultures and stories firsthand. Plus, it would make trivia nights a lot more interesting! \n\nWhat about your teleportation idea? Where\u2019s the first place you\u2019d teleport to? \u2708\ufe0f\u2728"

Efficiency is key! \ud83c\udf5d\u2728  \n\n**Follow-up Q:** If you could have dinner with any fictional character (from books, movies, etc.), who would it be and why?

I love the efficiency of your teleportation plan! \ud83c\udf5d\u2728\n\nIf I could have dinner with any fictional character, I think I\u2019d choose Gandalf from *The Lord of the Rings*. He\u2019s wise, has a wealth of stories to share, and I\u2019d love to hear his thoughts on the balance of good and evil in the world. Plus, I imagine he\u2019d have some great tales about his adventures and maybe even a few magical tricks up his sleeve!\n\nWhat about you\u2014would you lean more towards wisdom with Atticus or whimsical fun with Luna for your dinner?

Her mix of oddball wisdom (\u201cYou\u2019re just as sane as I am!\u201d) and fearless weirdness would make for the most entertaining night. We\u2019d trade conspiracy theories about Crumple-Horned Snorkacks and maybe even spot a Wrackspurt or two.  \n\n**Final Q (for now!):** What\u2019s a book, movie, or game you\u2019d recommend to someone who wants to feel *pure joy*? (My go-to: *Stardew Valley* for cozy vibes or *The Princess Bride* for witty, heartwarming chaos.)  \n\nLuna would be such a delight! I can already picture her explaining Nargles while sipping pumpkin juice, and you\u2019re right\u2014her brand of chaos is the best kind.  \n\nFor pure joy, I\u2019d recommend:  \n- **Book:** *The House in the Cerulean Sea* by TJ Klune\u2014it\u2019s like a warm hug in book form, full of whimsy and heart.  \n- **Movie:** *Paddington 2*\u2014it\u2019s impossible not to smile at that bear\u2019s earnest kindness (and Hugh Grant\u2019s hilariously over-the-top villain).  \n- **Game:** *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*\u2014fishing, decorating, and vibing with cute animal neighbors? Yes, please.  \n\n*Stardew Valley* and *The Princess Bride* are elite choices, though. Solid gold joy! \ud83c\udf1f  \n\n(Thanks for the fun chat\u2014this was a blast!

I\u2019d add:\n\n- **Book:** *Good Omens* by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett\u2014it's a hilarious take on the apocalypse with quirky characters and witty dialogue.\n- **Movie:** *Am\u00e9lie*\u2014it\u2019s a charming film that celebrates the small joys in life through the eyes of a whimsical young woman in Paris.\n- **Game:** *Journey*\u2014it\u2019s a beautiful, emotional experience that captures the joy of exploration and connection with others.\n\nThank you for this delightful chat!
