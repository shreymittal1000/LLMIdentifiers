People scour deserts or even their backyards for space rocks.  \n\nOr pivot to **octopus weirdness**: Their blue blood, ability to edit their own RNA, and habit of stealing crab traps make them basically ocean aliens. \ud83e\udd91  \n\nWhat\u2019s next\u2014space, sea, or something totally unexpected? \ud83d\ude80"
