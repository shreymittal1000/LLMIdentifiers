Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old\u2014and still perfectly edible! Bees work magic by drying the nectar and adding enzymes that make it acidic, creating a hostile environment for bacteria. So, in theory, your honey could outlive *civilizations*. \ud83d\udc1d\ud83c\udf6f  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udcd6 Creative Story Prompt:**  \n*\"You wake up to find a tiny door in your bedroom wall that wasn\u2019t there yesterday.

You take a deep breath and approach the tiny door, your mind racing with possibilities. \n\nWhat if the door leads to a world where you made different choices? You could meet versions of yourself who took risks you never dared to, or perhaps ones who played it safe. \n\nYou push the door open, and a whirlwind of colors and sounds rushes out. You step through, and suddenly, you\u2019re in a vibrant marketplace filled with people who look just like you\u2014but with different hairstyles, outfits, and even personalities. \n\nOne version of you, dressed in a flamboyant outfit, approaches you with a mischievous grin. \u201cYou\u2019re late!

A *punk-rock-you* offers to help\u2026 for a price.  \n3. **Embrace Chaos:** What if you *want* the other versions to invade your world? (Cue evil laugh.)  \n\n---\n\nOr\u2026 we could **flip the script entirely**: What if the note was a *fake* planted by one of the doppelg\u00e4ngers to lure you in? \ud83d\ude31  \n\nYour call!
