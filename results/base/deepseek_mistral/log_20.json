Every night, he would hear faint whispers and see a ghostly figure wandering the cliffs. One stormy night, the figure appeared again, and the keeper, driven by curiosity, followed it. The figure led him to a hidden cave, where he found a chest filled with treasure. The ghostly figure smiled at him, and from that night on, the whispers stopped, and the figure was never seen again. It was said that the ghost was the spirit of a pirate who had hidden his treasure in the cave and needed the keeper's help to finally rest in peace.\n\nYour turn to share a spooky tale or continue the word association!"
