The walls were lined with ancient books and artifacts, and in the center stood a figure robed and hooded, their face obscured by shadows. The figure held out a gnarled hand, beckoning her closer.\n\n\"Who are you?\" the woman asked, her voice echoing in the chamber. \"What is this place?\"\n\nThe figure lowered its hood, revealing an aged face with eyes that burned like embers. \"I am the Keeper of Time,\" it rasped. \"And this is the Chamber of Lost Moments.

Many lives were lost, and the town's spirit was forever altered. Your presence here means you have the power to change that fate, but you must act wisely. The key will unlock the past, but it will also test your resolve.\"\n\nThe woman nodded, her mind made up. \"I will do what must be done,\" she declared. \"But first, I need to know everything.
