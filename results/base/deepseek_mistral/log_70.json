It takes about 243 Earth days for Venus to complete one rotation, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun. Isn't that amazing?\n\nNow, let's play word association!

This unique tilt also causes extreme seasons on Uranus.\n\nNow, let's continue with word association if you'd like!
