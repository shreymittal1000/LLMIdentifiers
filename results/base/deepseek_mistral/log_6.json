Here's a suggestion for each:\n\n* **Round 2?** Let's try a trivia game on \"Weird Animal Facts.\" Here's your first question:\n\t+ Which animal has three hearts?\n\t\t- A) Octopus\n\t\t- B) Kangaroo\n\t\t- C) Platypus\n\t\t- D) Axolotl\n* **More space?** Here's a fascinating space mystery for you:\n\t+ The \"Wow! signal\" is one of the most famous unexplained signals ever detected. In 1977, astronomer Jerry R. Ehman was reviewing data from the Big Ear radio telescope when he found a strong narrowband radio signal that lasted for 72 seconds. The signal was so unusual that Ehman circled it on the printout and wrote \"Wow!\" in the margin. Despite numerous attempts, the signal has never been detected again, and its origin remains unknown. Some believe it could be evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, while others think it might be a natural phenomenon or even interference from a human-made source.\n* **Switch gears?** Based on your interest in space and fun facts, I'd recommend the movie **\"Interstellar\"** (2014) directed by Christopher Nolan. It's a thought-provoking science fiction film that explores themes of space travel, time dilation, and the search for a new home for humanity. The movie is known for its stunning visuals, complex storyline, and impressive performances by Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway.\n\nPlease choose the option you'd like to explore further, or let me know if you'd like me to surprise you with something else!"
