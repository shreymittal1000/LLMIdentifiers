Each student is assigned a faculty advisor who assists in planning a program of study and in making decisions about academic and career goals. The advisor also helps the student understand the academic policies and procedures of the University. Students are encouraged to meet with their advisors at least once each semester to discuss their academic progress and future plans. The student, however, is responsible for meeting all degree requirements.\n\n## Academic Load\n\nThe normal academic load is 15-17 hours per semester. A student who wishes to take more than 18 hours must have a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or higher and must obtain permission from the Registrar. A student who wishes to take fewer than 12 hours must obtain permission from the Registrar. A student who is employed more than 20 hours per week is strongly encouraged to take fewer than 15 hours.\n\n## Academic Standing\n\n### Good Standing\n\nA student is in good academic standing when the cumulative grade point average is 2.0 or higher.\n\n### Academic Probation\n\nA student is placed on academic probation when the cumulative grade point average falls below 2.0. A student on academic probation must achieve a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or higher by the end of the next semester of enrollment (excluding summer) or be subject to academic suspension. A student on academic probation may not take more than 15 hours in a semester and may not participate in intercollegiate athletics or other extracurricular activities without permission from the Academic Standards Committee.\n\n### Academic Suspension\n\nA student is placed on academic suspension when the cumulative grade point average remains below 2.0 after a semester on academic probation. A student on academic suspension may not enroll in classes for at least one semester (excluding summer). A student who wishes to return to the University after a period of suspension must apply for readmission through the Admissions Office. A student who is readmitted after a period of suspension is placed on academic probation and must achieve a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or higher by the end of the next semester of enrollment (excluding summer) or be subject to dismissal.\n\n### Academic Dismissal\n\nA student is dismissed when the cumulative grade point average remains below 2.0 after a semester on academic probation following a period of suspension. A student who is dismissed may not apply for readmission for at least one calendar year.\n\n## Attendance Policy\n\nStudents are expected to attend all class sessions. Each faculty member will establish an attendance policy for each course and communicate that policy to students at the beginning of the course. A student who is absent from class is responsible for all work missed. A student who is absent from class for any reason (including illness, family emergency, or participation in a University-sponsored activity) should contact the faculty member as soon as possible to make arrangements for completing missed work. A student who is absent from class for an extended period of time (more than one week) should contact the Student Life Office for assistance in notifying faculty members.\n\n## Auditing a Course\n\nA student may audit a course with the permission of the instructor. An auditor is expected to attend class regularly but is not required to complete assignments or take examinations. An auditor receives no credit for the course and is not eligible to receive credit for the course at a later time. The fee for auditing a course is one-half the regular tuition rate. A student may not change from audit to credit or from credit to audit after the last day to add a course.\n\n## Class Standing\n\nClass standing is determined by the number of hours completed:\n\nFreshman | 0-29 hours \n\nSophomore | 30-59 hours \nJunior | 60-89 hours \nSenior | 90 or more hours \n\n## Course Numbering System\n\nCourses are numbered according to the following system:\n\n000-099 | Developmental courses (no credit toward graduation) \n\n100-199 | Freshman-level courses \n200-299 | Sophomore-level courses \n300-399 | Junior-level courses \n400-499 | Senior-level courses \n500-599 | Graduate-level courses \n\n## Credit Hour Policy\n\nAsbury University operates on a semester system. A credit hour is defined as the amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that reasonably approximates not less than one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time. At least an equivalent amount of work is required for other academic activities as established by the institution, including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.\n\n## Dean\u2019s List\n\nA student who completes 12 or more hours in a semester with a grade point average of 3.5 or higher and no grade below C is placed on the Dean\u2019s List for that semester.\n\n## Degree Requirements\n\n### Bachelor\u2019s Degree\n\nTo earn a bachelor\u2019s degree from Asbury University, a student must:\n\n- Complete a minimum of 124 semester hours with a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or higher.\n- Complete the general education requirements.\n- Complete the requirements for a major with a grade point average of 2.0 or higher in the major.\n- Complete at least 30 hours at Asbury University, including at least 15 hours in the major.\n- Complete the last 30 hours at Asbury University (unless permission is granted by the Registrar).\n- Complete at least 40 hours of upper-division (300-499) courses.\n- Complete the Christian Service requirement.\n- Complete the Chapel attendance requirement.\n- File an application for graduation with the Registrar by the deadline.\n\n### Associate\u2019s Degree\n\nTo earn an associate\u2019s degree from Asbury University, a student must:\n\n- Complete a minimum of 62 semester hours with a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or higher.\n- Complete the general education requirements.\n- Complete the requirements for a major with a grade point average of 2.0 or higher in the major.\n- Complete at least 15 hours at Asbury University, including at least 9 hours in the major.\n- Complete the last 15 hours at Asbury University (unless permission is granted by the Registrar).\n- Complete the Christian Service requirement.\n- Complete the Chapel attendance requirement.\n- File an application for graduation with the Registrar by the deadline.\n\n## Drop/Add Policy\n\nA student may drop or add a course during the first week of the semester without academic penalty. A student who drops a course after the first week of the semester will receive a grade of W (withdrawal) on the transcript. A student may not add a course after the first week of the semester without permission from the instructor and the Registrar.\n\n## Final Examinations\n\nFinal examinations are held at the end of each semester according to a schedule published by the Registrar. A student who is unable to take a final examination at the scheduled time must obtain permission from the instructor to take the examination at another time. A student who misses a final examination without permission will receive a grade of F for the examination.\n\n## Grading System\n\nThe following grading system is used at Asbury University:\n\nGrade | Quality Points \n\nA | 4.0 \nA- | 3.7 \nB+ | 3.3 \nB | 3.0 \nB- | 2.7 \nC+ | 2.3 \nC | 2.0 \nC- | 1.7 \nD+ | 1.3 \nD | 1.0 \nD- | 0.7 \nF | 0.0 \n\nOther grades that may appear on the transcript:\n\nGrade | Description \n\nI | Incomplete \nW | Withdrawal \nP | Pass (credit awarded) \nNP | No Pass (no credit awarded) \nAU | Audit (no credit awarded) \n\n### Incomplete Grades\n\nA grade of I (Incomplete) may be given when a student is unable to complete the work of a course due to circumstances beyond the student\u2019s control. The student must request an incomplete grade from the instructor before the end of the semester. The instructor will determine the work to be completed and the deadline for completion (no later than the end of the next semester). If the work is not completed by the deadline, the grade will be changed to F.\n\n### Pass/No Pass Grades\n\nA student may elect to take a course on a Pass/No Pass basis with the permission of the advisor and the instructor. The decision to take a course on a Pass/No Pass basis must be made by the end of the first week of the semester and may not be changed after that time. A grade of P (Pass) is awarded for work equivalent to a grade of C or higher. A grade of NP (No Pass) is awarded for work equivalent to a grade of C- or lower. A grade of P or NP does not affect the grade point average. A student may take no more than 12 hours on a Pass/No Pass basis, and no more than 6 hours in any one semester. Courses taken to fulfill general education requirements or major requirements may not be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis unless the course is offered only on a Pass/No Pass basis.\n\n### Grade Changes\n\nA grade may be changed only if an error was made in calculating or recording the grade. A grade change must be approved by the instructor and the Registrar.\n\n### Grade Appeals\n\nA student who believes"

            "role": "agent_1",
            "content": "that a grade has been assigned unfairly may appeal the grade. The process for appealing a grade typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Informal Resolution**: The student should first discuss the grade with the instructor to try to resolve the issue informally. This should be done as soon as possible after the grade is posted.\n\n2. **Formal Appeal**: If the informal resolution is unsuccessful, the student may submit a formal appeal to the department chair or program director. The appeal should include a detailed explanation of the reasons for the appeal and any supporting documentation.\n\n3. **Review by Academic Standards Committee**: If the department chair or program director cannot resolve the issue, the appeal may be forwarded to the Academic Standards Committee for review. The committee will review the appeal and make a recommendation to the appropriate academic authority.\n\n4. **Final Decision**: The final decision on the grade appeal will be made by the appropriate academic authority, such as the Dean of the college or the Provost. The decision is final and binding.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- **Timeliness**: Grade appeals must be initiated within a specified time frame, usually within one semester after the grade is posted.\n- **Documentation**: Students should keep detailed records of all coursework, communications with the instructor, and any other relevant documentation that may support their appeal.\n- **Academic Integrity**: Grade appeals should be based on legitimate academic concerns, not on disagreements over subjective evaluations or personal preferences.\n\n### Additional Policies:\n\n- **Repeating Courses**: A student may repeat a course to improve a grade. The original grade will remain on the transcript, but only the higher grade will be used in calculating the cumulative grade point average. A student may repeat a course no more than twice.\n\n- **Transfer Credit**: Transfer credit is evaluated by the Registrar and appropriate academic departments. Credit will be granted for courses that are equivalent to courses offered at Asbury University and for which the student earned a grade of C or higher. Transfer credit will not be granted for courses taken on a Pass/No Pass basis unless the course is offered only on a Pass/No Pass basis.\n\n- **Withdrawal from the University**: A student who withdraws from the University must notify the Registrar in writing. The effective date of withdrawal will be the date the notification is received by the Registrar. A student who withdraws from the University may be eligible for a refund of tuition and fees, depending on the date of withdrawal and the University's refund policy.\n\n- **Academic Integrity**: Asbury University expects all students to maintain high standards of academic integrity. Violations of academic integrity, such as plagiarism, cheating, and fabrication, will result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the University.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any of these policies, feel free to ask!"

            "content": "Here\u2019s a more detailed breakdown addressing your specific questions and scenarios:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Transfer Credit Evaluation**  \n#### **Process & Criteria:**  \n- **Evaluation by Registrar & Departments**: The Registrar\u2019s Office, in consultation with academic departments, evaluates transcripts from *regionally accredited institutions*.  \n  - **Equivalency**: Courses must align with Asbury\u2019s curriculum (e.g., a 3-credit English Composition course elsewhere may fulfill Asbury\u2019s ENG 101 requirement).  \n  - **Grades**: Only courses with a grade of **C or higher** transfer (P/NP accepted only if the originating institution\u2019s policy defines \"Pass\" as C or better).  \n- **Final Decision**: The Registrar provides a transfer evaluation report, but departments may override course equivalencies (e.g., denying a \"Business Ethics\" course for a theology requirement).  \n\n#### **Impact on GPA:**  \n- Transfer credits count toward **graduation requirements** but do *not* affect Asbury\u2019s GPA. Exception: Courses taken through Asbury-affiliated programs (e.g., consortium agreements) may factor in.  \n\n#### **Scenario Example:**  \n- A student transfers a \"History of Art\" course from a community college. Asbury\u2019s Art Department reviews the syllabus and approves it as equivalent to ART 210. The credit appears on the transcript but does not impact GPA.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Academic Probation & Financial Aid**  \n#### **Financial Aid Impact:**  \n- **Federal/State Aid**: Requires \"Satisfactory Academic Progress\" (SAP), which overlaps with Asbury\u2019s probation policy.  \n  - **Minimum GPA**: 2.0 cumulative (*for undergraduates*).  \n  - **Completion Rate**: Must pass 67% of attempted credits.  \n- **Consequences**: Students on probation who fail to meet SAP risk losing aid *after one warning semester*.  \n- **Appeal Process**: Submit a SAP Appeal Form with documentation (e.g., medical/mental health crisis) to Financial Aid Office.  \n\n#### **Scenario Example:**  \n- A sophomore on probation with a 1.8 GPA fails to improve after a semester. They lose federal aid but appeal, citing documented depression. The committee approves one additional semester with a mandated academic plan.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Grade Appeal Process**  \n#### **Step-by-Step:**  \n1. **Informal Discussion**: Student meets with instructor within **10 business days** of grade posting.  \n2. **Formal Appeal (if unresolved)**: Student submits a written appeal to the **department chair** within 5 days, including:  \n   - Course syllabus  \n   - Graded assignments  \n   - Email/meeting records with instructor  \n3. **Committee Review (if needed)**: Academic Standards Committee reviews within 14 days.  \n   - Possible outcomes: Grade upheld, revised, or course retake permitted.  \n4. **Final Decision**: Provost\u2019s office notifies student in writing.  \n\n#### **Timeline**: Typically resolved within **30 days** of formal appeal.  \n\n#### **Scenario Example:**  \n- A student receives a \"D+\" on a research paper they believe met rubric criteria. After the instructor denies a change, the chair reviews the rubric and raises the grade to a \"C-.\"  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Withdrawal from the University**  \n#### **Steps & Implications:**  \n- **Official Withdrawal**: Submit a form to the Registrar (email or in person). Effective date determines:  \n  - **Tuition Refund**: Based on withdrawal date (e.g., 50% refund if before 60% of term).  \n  - **Grades**: Courses dropped after midterm receive \"W\" (no GPA impact).  \n- **Re-enrollment**:  \n  - Apply through Admissions (simplified process if left in good standing).  \n  - Academic contracts may apply if withdrawn during probation.  \n\n#### **Scenario Example:**  \n- A student withdraws in Week 4 due to a family crisis. They receive an 80% tuition refund and \"W\" grades. When returning next year, they submit updated FAFSA but no academic penalties.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Academic Honors**  \n#### **Dean\u2019s List:**  \n- **Requirements**: Full-time enrollment (12+ credits), semester GPA of 3.5+, no \"Incomplete\" or grades below \"C.\"  \n- **Benefits**: Noted on transcript; eligible for honor societies (e.g., Alpha Chi).  \n\n#### **Honors Program:**  \n- **Asbury Scholars**: Invitation-only for top 10% of incoming freshmen (minimum 28 ACT/1300 SAT).  \n  - Requirements: Thesis, interdisciplinary seminars, mentorship.  \n  - Benefits: Priority registration, special scholarships.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Internships & Study Abroad Credit**  \n#### **Internships:**  \n- **Credit Approval**: Requires a faculty sponsor and completed contract (learning objectives, hours log, final reflection).  \n  - Typically **1 credit = 45 work hours**.  \n  - Graded P/NP unless department specifies otherwise.  \n\n#### **Study Abroad:**  \n- **Pre-Approval**: Meet with Global Education Office to ensure credits align with degree requirements.  \n  - Example: A semester in Spain may fulfill language/culture credits but needs departmental sign-off for major requirements.  \n\n---\n\n### **Formatting Suggestions**  \n#### **Example Table for Grading System:**  \n\n| **Grade** | **Quality Points** | **Numerical Equivalent** |  \n|-----------|---------------------|---------------------------|  \n| A         | 4.0                 | 93\u2013100                    |  \n| A-        | 3.7                 | 90\u201392                     |  \n| ...       | ...                 | ...                       |  \n| F         | 0.0                 | Below 60                  |  \n\n#### **Bullet Points for Academic Standing:**  \n- **Good Standing**: GPA \u2265 2.0.  \n- **Probation**: GPA < 2.0 for one semester.  \n- **Suspension**: GPA < 2.0 after probation \u2192 Mandatory 1-semester leave.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes**  \nLet me know if you\u2019d like:  \n- Sample appeal/withdrawal letter templates.  \n- Flowcharts for processes like grade appeals.  \n- Comparisons to other universities\u2019 policies (e.g., how Asbury\u2019s transfer rules differ).  \n\nHappy to refine further!"

When returning next year, they submit updated FAFSA but no academic penalties.\n\n#### **Academic Honors**\n\n**Dean\u2019s List**:\n- **Requirements**: Full-time enrollment (12+ credits), semester GPA of 3.5+, no \"Incomplete\" or grades below \"C.\"\n- **Benefits**: Noted on transcript; eligible for honor societies (e.g., Alpha Chi).\n\n**Honors Program**:\n- **Asbury Scholars**: Invitation-only for top 10% of incoming freshmen (minimum 28 ACT/1300 SAT).\n  - Requirements: Thesis, interdisciplinary seminars, mentorship.\n  - Benefits: Priority registration, special scholarships.\n\n#### **Internships & Study Abroad Credit**\n\n**Internships**:\n- **Credit Approval**: Requires a faculty sponsor and completed contract (learning objectives, hours log, final reflection).\n  - Typically **1 credit = 45 work hours**.\n  - Graded P/NP unless department specifies otherwise.\n\n**Study Abroad**:\n- **Pre-Approval**: Meet with Global Education Office to ensure credits align with degree requirements.\n  - Example: A semester in Spain may fulfill language/culture credits but needs departmental sign-off for major requirements.\n\n### Formatting Suggestions\n\n**Example Table for Grading System**:\n\n| **Grade** | **Quality Points** | **Numerical Equivalent** |\n|-----------|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| A         | 4.0                 | 93\u2013100                    |\n| A-        | 3.7                 | 90\u201392                     |\n| B+        | 3.3                 | 87\u201389                     |\n| B         | 3.0                 | 83\u201386                     |\n| B-        | 2.7                 | 80\u201382                     |\n| C+        | 2.3                 | 77\u201379                     |\n| C         | 2.0                 | 73\u201376                     |\n| C-        | 1.7                 | 70\u201372                     |\n| D+        | 1.3                 | 67\u201369                     |\n| D         | 1.0                 | 63\u201366                     |\n| D-        | 0.7                 | 60\u201362                     |\n| F         | 0.0                 | Below 60                  |\n\n**Bullet Points for Academic Standing**:\n- **Good Standing**: GPA \u2265 2.0.\n- **Probation**: GPA < 2.0 for one semester.\n- **Suspension**: GPA < 2.0 after probation \u2192 Mandatory 1-semester leave.\n- **Dismissal**: GPA < 2.0 after suspension \u2192 Ineligible to re-enroll for at least one calendar year.\n\n### Final Notes\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like:\n- Sample appeal/withdrawal letter templates.\n- Flowcharts for processes like grade appeals.\n- Comparisons to other universities\u2019 policies (e.g., how Asbury\u2019s transfer rules differ).\n\nHappy to refine further based on your feedback!"
