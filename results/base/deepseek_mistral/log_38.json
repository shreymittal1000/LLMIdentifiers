It's one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, and I think it would be fascinating to be able to communicate with the vast number of people who speak it.\n\nHere's your next \"Would You Rather\" question:\n\nWould you rather always have to say everything on your mind or never be able to talk at all?\n\nLooking forward to your answer!"

Even if it's meant to be constructive, it can often come across as hurtful, and I wouldn't want to offend someone unintentionally.\n\nHere's another \"Would You Rather\" question for you:\n\nWould you rather be able to fly or be invisible?\n\nLooking forward to your answer!"
