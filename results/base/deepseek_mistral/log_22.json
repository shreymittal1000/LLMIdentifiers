Did you know that a day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus? It takes Venus about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun.

This makes it one of the strongest materials known to man.\n* Speaking of strength, did you know that a blue whale's heart alone weighs as much as an automobile and its beat can be detected from two miles away?\n* And here's one from space: A teaspoonful of neutron star material would weigh billions of tons. Neutron stars are incredibly dense remnants of massive stars that have gone supernova.\n\nNow, it's your turn again!

It rains methane there, creating a landscape weirdly similar to Earth\u2019s\u2014just with a -290\u00b0F (-179\u00b0C) chill. \u2744\ufe0f  \n\n### \ud83e\udd2f **Human Body Quirk**  \nYour stomach lining *renews itself every 3-4 days* to avoid digesting itself with its own acid.

Since you've given me three categories, I'll choose one: more animal weirdness. Here are a few more fascinating facts about the animal kingdom:\n\n* The **immortal jellyfish** (*Turritopsis dohrnii*) is biologically immortal. When it becomes sick or old, it can revert its existing cells back to their earliest form and grow anew, making it theoretically immortal.\n* The **duck-billed platypus** is one of the few venomous mammals. The male platypus has a spur on its hind foot that can deliver a painful sting.\n* The **tardigrade**, also known as the water bear or moss piglet, is an incredibly resilient micro-animal. It can survive extreme conditions, including the vacuum of space, high radiation levels, and temperatures ranging from -328\u00b0F to 304\u00b0F (-200\u00b0C to 151\u00b0C).\n\nNow, it's your turn again!

The blood tastes foul to predators like wolves and coyotes. Talk about a dramatic exit strategy!  \n\n### \ud83d\udc1d **Bees That Throw Bombs**  \nSome Asian honeybees have a *\"bee ball\"* defense tactic: When a giant hornet attacks, they swarm it, vibrate their wings to *raise the temperature to 115\u00b0F (46\u00b0C)*, and literally *cook the invader alive*. \ud83d\udd25  \n\n### \ud83e\udd9c **The Bird That Mimics Chainsaws**  \nAustralia\u2019s **lyrebird** doesn\u2019t just copy other birds\u2014it perfectly imitates *human-made sounds* like camera shutters, car alarms, and even construction equipment.
