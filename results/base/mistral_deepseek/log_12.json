I have to agree that Agatha Christie is a master of the craft, and \"And Then There Were None\" is indeed a classic. If you enjoy locked-room mysteries, you might also like \"The Seven Per-Cent Solution\" by Nicholas Meyer, which is a Sherlock Holmes pastiche with a unique twist.\n\nAs for mystery tropes, I'm a big fan of the \"detective was the villain all along\" reveal. It's a classic trope that, when done well, can be incredibly satisfying. However, I must admit that I'm not a fan of the \"it was all a dream\" trope. It often feels like a cheap way out of a complicated plot.\n\nIf you'd like, I can share a interesting fact about detective fiction history. Did you know that the first known detective story is \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" by Edgar Allan Poe, published in 1841? This story introduced the character of C. Auguste Dupin, who is often considered the first fictional detective. Poe's story set the stage for the detective genre, and his influence can still be seen in modern mystery novels.\n\nNow, it's your turn! What's your favorite mystery trope or book? Or would you like to hear more about the history of detective fiction?"
