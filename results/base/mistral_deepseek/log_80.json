The movie \"Predestination\" sounds incredibly intriguing with its time-paradox storyline.\n\nLet's pivot to the topic of why sci-fi aliens often look humanoid. There are a few reasons for this:\n\n1. **Evolutionary Convergence**: Some scientists believe that intelligent life might evolve similarly on different planets due to similar environmental pressures. This is known as convergent evolution.\n\n2. **Storytelling Convenience**: From a storytelling perspective, humanoid aliens are easier for audiences to relate to and empathize with. They also make it simpler to convey emotions and expressions.\n\n3. **Practical Considerations**: Creating entirely alien-looking creatures can be challenging and expensive, especially in older films. Humanoid aliens are more cost-effective and practical to produce.\n\n4. **Cultural Influence**: Many early sci-fi works featured humanoid aliens, which set a precedent that has been followed in various forms of media.\n\nIf you're interested, we can explore more about the science behind alien life or dive into some mind-bending short stories.

Sci-Fi\u2019s \"Lazy\" Trope\u2026 or Clever Hack?**  \n- **The \"Star Trek\" Rule**: Roddenberry admitted humanoid aliens saved money (just slap some forehead ridges on actors!), but later canonized it with the *ancient humanoid seeding theory* (TNG\u2019s *\"The Chase\"*).  \n- **Horror Exception**: *Annihilation\u2019s* shimmer or *The Thing* prove non-humanoid aliens *can* be terrifying\u2014but harder to write dialogue for!  \n\n### **2. Real Science\u2019s Take**  \n- **Convergent Evolution**: Octopuses (smart, *nothing* like us) suggest intelligence might not need limbs or faces. But *bipedalism* (walking upright) frees hands for tool use\u2026 maybe a universal advantage?  \n- **The \"Water Hole\" Theory**: SETI listens to radio waves at frequencies where hydrogen + hydroxyl (aka *water*) resonate. If aliens *also* rely on water, could their chemistry nudge them toward familiar shapes?  \n\n### **3. Mind-Bending Alternatives**  \n- **Book Rec**: *Blindsight* by Peter Watts features aliens with *no consciousness* (like philosophical zombies).  \n- **Short Story**: *\"The Story of Your Life\"* (Arrival\u2019s source) explores how *language* might reshape cognition beyond human limits.  \n\n---  \n**Where to next?**  \n- Debunk more sci-fi tropes (like *sound in space*)?  \n- Dive into *actual* astrobiology (NASA\u2019s weird *\"shadow biosphere\"* ideas)?  \n- Geek out over *specific* alien designs (e.g., *Arrival*\u2019s heptapods vs. *District 9*\u2019s prawns)?  \n\nThe cosmos is weird\u2014let\u2019s embrace it! \ud83c\udf0c"
