(Future eclipses will be total *fail* because the moon will look too small to cover the sun! \u2026in 600 million years.)  \n\nFor my next trick, let\u2019s dive into **Pop Culture**:  \n\n**The iconic \"Wilhelm Scream\"**\u2014that stock sound effect used in *Star Wars*, *Indiana Jones*, and hundreds of other films\u2014was recorded in 1951 for a movie called *Distant Drums*. It got its name when a sound editor jokically dubbed it after a character who gets eaten by an alligator in *The Charge at Feather River* (1953).
