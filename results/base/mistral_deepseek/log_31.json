It takes Venus about 243 Earth days to rotate on its axis once, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun. Isn't that amazing?\n\nNow, it's your turn!

Two hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third keeps circulation flowing to the organs. When they swim, the third heart *stops beating*\u2014which is why they often prefer crawling. \ud83d\udc19  \n\nNow, I\u2019d love to pivot to *you*!

Being able to express myself through various instruments would be an incredible experience. Plus, I could finally learn to play that beautiful piano piece you love so much!\n\nNow, it's your turn again!

(Example: *Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren\u2019t.*)  \n- **Evening**: Gather friends for a \"Space & Spice\" potluck\u2014dishes must be from different cultures *or* inspired by celestial bodies. (Moon cheese platter? Mars chili? Debate whether black holes would taste like licorice.)  \n\n**Why this holiday?** To combat routine with wonder, connect people through playful learning, and justify eating astronaut ice cream for dinner.  \n\n**Alternate idea**: *\"Mischief Night 2.0\"* where everyone does *one* harmless, silly prank (replacing coffee with decaf doesn\u2019t count\u2014think more like filling the office with balloons).  \n\n**Your turn**: Would you add/change anything to *Global Curiosity Day*?

It's a great way to learn interesting facts about each other and spark curiosity.\n- **Late Evening**: Host a movie night featuring films that inspire curiosity and wonder, like \"Contact,\" \"Interstellar,\" or \"The Martian.\"\n\nI also really like the idea of \"Mischief Night 2.0\"!
