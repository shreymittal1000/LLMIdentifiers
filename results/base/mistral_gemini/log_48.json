The California roll, with its avocado, crab, and cucumber filling, is a popular example that originated in the United States.\n   - **Sashimi**: While not technically sushi (as it doesn't include rice), sashimi is often served alongside sushi. It consists of thinly sliced raw fish or other seafood, typically served with soy sauce and wasabi.\n   - **Oshizushi**: Also known as \"pressed sushi,\" oshizushi is made by pressing sushi rice and toppings into a wooden mold. It originated in the Kansai region, particularly in Osaka.\n\n2. **The history and regional variations of ramen**:\n   - Ramen is a noodle soup dish that originated in China but has since become a staple of Japanese cuisine.

It is often described as a savory or meaty flavor and is found in various foods, such as mushrooms, soy sauce, and fermented products.\n   - In Japanese cooking, umami is achieved through the use of ingredients like:\n     - **Dashi**: A broth made from kombu (kelp) and katsuobushi (bonito flakes), dashi is a fundamental ingredient in many Japanese dishes and provides a rich, umami flavor.\n     - **Soy Sauce**: Made from fermented soybeans, soy sauce is a versatile condiment that adds depth and umami to various dishes.\n     - **Miso**: A paste made from fermented soybeans, miso is used in soups, sauces, and marinades, providing a unique umami flavor.\n     - **Fermented Ingredients**: Foods like natto (fermented soybeans) and umeboshi (pickled plums) contribute to the umami profile of Japanese cuisine.\n\n4. **Lesser-known but delicious Japanese dishes**:\n   - **Okonomiyaki**: Often described as a savory pancake, okonomiyaki is made from a batter of flour, water, eggs, shredded cabbage, and various other ingredients, such as pork, seafood, or cheese.
