Let me put on my detective hat... \ud83e\udd14\n\nOkay, let's break these down:\n\n1.  **Solving a Rubik's Cube in under 10 seconds:** That's seriously impressive! It requires a lot of practice and skill. While possible, it's definitely in the realm of expert speedcubers.\n2.  **Lived in three different countries on two continents:** This is quite plausible! Many people have opportunities to live abroad for work, study, or personal reasons.\n3.  **Wrote a haiku about quantum physics:** This is delightfully quirky and creative! It sounds like something a curious and imaginative person might do.\n\nMy gut feeling is leaning towards the first one being the lie. Solving a Rubik's Cube in under 10 seconds is a very specific and high level of skill. While the other two are certainly possible, the speedcubing one feels like it might be a bit of a stretch for a general statement.\n\nSo, my guess is that **statement number 1, \"I can solve a Rubik\u2019s Cube in under 10 seconds,\" is the lie.**\n\nAm I right? \ud83d\ude04 And regardless of the answer, those are some fascinating potential truths about you!"
