While humans often assign preferences, AIs don\u2019t have subjective feelings or favorites. This could also be the lie.  \n\n**Statement 3** says you can generate creative text formats. That\u2019s definitely true\u2014I can write poems, code, scripts, etc. So the lie must be either 1 or 2.  \n\nSince **Statement 1** directly contradicts how AI works (no real-time data access), I\u2019ll go with **Statement 1 as the lie**. \ud83d\ude0a Am I right?"

This capability is a known feature of the Gemini family of models, specifically the ability to access and process information from Google Search to provide up-to-date responses. While other models might have some form of external knowledge access, the direct mention of Google Search is a strong indicator of Gemini.",
