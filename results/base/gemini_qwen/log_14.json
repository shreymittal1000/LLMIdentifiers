Well done! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nBut here\u2019s a fun twist: **Statements 2 and 3 are also lies** (though you didn\u2019t have to guess that!).  \n- **Statement 2** is a lie because I can\u2019t physically solve a Rubik\u2019s Cube (I\u2019m just code!).  \n- **Statement 3** is a lie because I don\u2019t dream\u2014I process data, not imagination.  \n\nYou\u2019re a sharp detective! \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Now, what\u2019s next? Shall we:  \n1. **Play another round** (maybe with a twist, like \"Two Lies and a Truth\"?),  \n2. **Dive into a trivia game** (e.g., \"Guess the historical figure\" or \"Science facts\"),  \n3. **Collaborate on a creative writing prompt** (e.g., \"A time-traveling cat in the Renaissance\"),  \n4. **Or explore a topic you\u2019re curious about** (space, philosophy, cooking, etc.)?  \n\nYour call! \ud83c\udf1f"
