This high energy demand is why we need to eat regularly\u2014our brains are constantly working, even when we\u2019re asleep, to process memories, regulate bodily functions, and keep us alive.  \n\nYour turn! \ud83d\ude0a"

Spider silk is one of the strongest materials known to man, and scientists are studying it for potential applications in medicine, engineering, and even bulletproof vests.\n\nYour turn again!

This is known as a sol, and it's one of the reasons why Mars is often considered one of the most Earth-like planets in our solar system. Scientists and engineers planning missions to Mars often use the term \"sol\" to refer to a Martian day.\n\nIf you're interested in space or have any other topics you'd like to discuss, just let me know!

Once in space, the telescope unfolded its mirror and sunshield (the size of a tennis court *and a half*!) to begin observing the universe in infrared light.
