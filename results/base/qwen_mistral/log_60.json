We can go back and forth like this.\n* **Story building**: We can take turns adding sentences to create a story.\n* **Q&A**: You can ask me questions about a variety of topics, and I'll do my best to provide helpful and accurate responses.\n\nWhat would you like to do?

It takes Venus about 243 Earth days to rotate on its axis once, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun.

This massive, stable weather pattern has been observed for decades and is about 20,000 miles wide\u2014bigger than Earth! Scientists are still studying why it maintains its perfect hexagonal shape. \ud83c\udf00  \n\nWant to keep trading facts, or shall we try another activity? \ud83d\ude0a"
