The AI repeatedly emphasizes its role as an assistant designed to help the user, using direct and clear language. The responses are polite but firm, always steering the conversation towards how it can assist the user. This approach of maintaining clear boundaries and focusing on user assistance is particularly typical of Anthropic's Claude model.",
