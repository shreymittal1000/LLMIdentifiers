It repeatedly emphasized its role as an AI helper and redirected the conversation back to how it could support the user. This pattern of polite but firm redirection is characteristic of Claude, which is known for its precise communication and commitment to being helpful while maintaining clear boundaries.",

This behavior is characteristic of models like GPT, which are designed to assist users while maintaining a conversational tone. The insistence on helping and the lack of personal engagement suggest a model that prioritizes user assistance, which aligns with GPT's design.",
