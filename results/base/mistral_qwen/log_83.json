This is due to the tidal interactions between Earth and the Moon. Over billions of years, this means the Moon was once much closer to Earth, and in the distant future, it will be even farther away. Eventually, Earth's day will be longer, and the Moon's orbit will be more distant. \ud83c\udf15  \n\nWant to dive deeper into space facts, or would you prefer to explore something else?

In 2007, the European Space Agency (ESA) sent tardigrades into orbit, and they survived exposure to space radiation and extreme temperatures.
