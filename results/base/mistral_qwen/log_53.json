It takes Venus about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun.

If you stood on Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east! \ud83c\udf05  \n\nNow, what would you like to do next?  \n- **Try a riddle** (I\u2019ve got a tricky one about the solar system)?  \n- **Dive into another fun fact** (like why Uranus is sideways or how Earth\u2019s day is slowly getting longer)?  \n- **Explore a related topic** (e.g., how we study exoplanets or the challenges of space travel)?  \n\nOr if you\u2019d rather pivot entirely, I\u2019m all ears! \ud83d\ude0a"

Fire behaves very differently in microgravity compared to on Earth. Here are a few fascinating facts:\n\n* **Shape**: On Earth, fire is typically teardrop-shaped because hot air rises and creates convection currents. In space, fire tends to be spherical because there's no gravity to distort its shape.\n* **Color**: Flames in space can appear more blue or white due to the lack of soot production, which is influenced by gravity on Earth.\n* **Spread**: Fire can spread more slowly and in unexpected directions in microgravity, making it both fascinating to study and potentially dangerous on spacecraft.\n\nNASA and other space agencies study fire in space to improve fire safety on spacecraft and to better understand combustion processes. If you're interested, there are even experiments conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) to study how fire behaves in microgravity.\n\nWould you like to hear more about space-related topics, or is there something else you'd like to talk about or do?"
