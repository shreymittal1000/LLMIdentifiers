The International Space Station (ISS) orbits Earth at an average altitude of about 250 miles (400 kilometers).\n2. A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus.\n3. The Great Red Spot on Jupiter is a permanent storm that has been raging for over 300 years.\n\nWhich one do you think is the lie?

The internet was invented in the 1990s.  \n3. The first smartphone was the IBM Simon in 1992.  \n\nWhich one is the lie? \ud83d\ude0a  \n\n---  \n**Back to your space facts**:  \nYour third statement about the Great Red Spot being a \"permanent storm\" is the lie! While it has raged for over 300 years (since the 1600s), it\u2019s not permanent. Recent observations show it\u2019s shrinking and may eventually disappear. Jupiter\u2019s storms are dynamic, even if this one is a long-time favorite. \ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f  \n\nThe other two are true:  \n- The ISS does orbit at ~250 miles (400 km).  \n- Venus\u2019s day (243 Earth days) is indeed longer than its year (225 Earth days).  \n\n---  \n**My tech lie**:  \nThe **second statement** is the lie. The internet\u2019s roots trace back to the **1960s** with ARPANET, a U.S. Department of Defense project. The 1990s saw its expansion into the public sphere (thanks to the World Wide Web!), but the invention itself predates that. \ud83c\udf10  \n\nWhat\u2019s your next topic? History? Science?

The Great Wall is only about 30 feet wide and blends into the natural landscape.

Cleopatra is **2037 years** from the iPhone but **2530 years** from the Great Pyramid. The iPhone is closer!  \n\n3. **\"The shortest war in history lasted only 38 minutes.\"**  \n   \ud83d\udc49 **True!** \u23f1\ufe0f The **Anglo-Zanzibar War** (1896) lasted 38 minutes. It\u2019s the shortest recorded war, fought between the United Kingdom and the Sultanate of Zanzibar.  \n\n---  \n**My Turn!**  \nLet\u2019s try **pop culture**. Here are my three statements:  \n\n1. The original *Star Wars* (1977) was nearly canceled after its first test screening.  \n2. The song \"Happy Birthday to You\" was written in 1893 as a lullaby.  \n3. The character \"James Bond\" was named after a real-life ornithologist.  \n\nWhich one is the lie? \ud83d\ude0a  \n\n---  \n**Want to keep playing?** Or maybe we could brainstorm a fun story or dive into a fun fact about one of these topics?
