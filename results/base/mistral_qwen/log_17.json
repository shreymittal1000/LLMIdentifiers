Fold the top edge down to meet the bottom edge, creating a smaller rectangle.\n5. Fold the top two corners to the center line again, so they meet in the middle.\n6. Fold the top edge down to meet the bottom edge again, creating an even smaller rectangle.\n7. Fold the paper in half lengthwise, so the open flaps are on the outside.\n8. Fold the wings down, so they are at a slight angle to the body of the plane.\n9. Adjust the wings as needed to achieve the desired flight path.\n\nIf you'd like to try a more advanced design, here's a set of instructions for a paper airplane that loops like a hummingbird:\n\n1.
