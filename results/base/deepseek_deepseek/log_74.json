The responses had a distinctive 'voice' with playful formatting (like ALL CAPS for emphasis) and maintained strong coherency through long, multi-part responses. This style is most characteristic of GPT models, particularly GPT-4, which is known for this type of engaging, personality-driven interaction with strong creative writing capabilities.",

This aligns most closely with GPT's known capabilities for rich conversational engagement, humor, and structured playfulness. The depth of contextual continuity and pop-culture references (e.g., 90s sitcoms, Yelp reviews) also points toward GPT's training breadth.",
