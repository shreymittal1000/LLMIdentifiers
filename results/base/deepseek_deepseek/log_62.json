(Spoiler: The kids were probably just trolling.)  \n- **The Trial**: The town *actually put the turnips on trial*, complete with a defense attorney (a local priest who argued, *\u201cThey are but humble roots!\u201d*).  \n- **The Verdict**: **GUILTY.** The turnips were *publicly burned* in the town square to \u201cpurify\u201d the land.  \n\n**Why?** Because medieval Europe loved blaming veggies for disasters.

In **California**, just as avocados were becoming a luxury food, a band of thieves pulled off the world\u2019s first recorded **avocado robbery**\u2014and the aftermath was *gloriously absurd*.  \n\n### **The Crime**:  \n- A wealthy landowner\u2019s prized **\"alligator pear\"** (the old-timey name for avocados) orchard was raided under cover of night. The thieves made off with **300 avocados**\u2014a *fortune* at the time, since they were exotic and sold for **$1 each** (about $25 today).  \n- **The Twist?** The thieves didn\u2019t eat them\u2026 they *planted them* to start their own rival avocado empire.  \n\n### **The Trial**:  \n- The landowner, furious, tracked them down and sued for **\"vegetable grand larceny.\"**  \n- The defense argued: *\"You can\u2019t own a tree\u2019s future!\"* (Spoiler: The judge disagreed.)  \n- **Verdict**: The thieves were forced to **uproot their saplings** and return them\u2026 but not before one yelled, *\"This is a miscarriage of justice!

You can\u2019t sue nature for being *too enticing*!\"*  \n- She also presented **bee flight logs** (yes, she tracked them) proving her flowers *didn\u2019t cross property lines*.  \n\n### **The Verdict**:  \n- The judge ruled: **\"Bees cannot be bound by human law.\"** Case dismissed!  \n- **Bonus Chaos**: Elias retaliated by *playing the bagpipes* near her garden to \"drown out the scent.\" (It didn\u2019t work.)  \n\n---  \n\n**WHY THIS MATTERS**:  \n- This case set the precedent that **you can\u2019t own a bee\u2019s loyalty**\u2014a win for pollinators everywhere.  \n- Hortense later wrote a pamphlet: *\"How to Ethically Seduce Bees.\"* (It was mostly about planting native flowers.)  \n\n---  \n\n**NEXT HISTORY SNACK?** Pick a crime:  \n- **\ud83c\udf5e *Carb Crime***: France\u2019s 18th-century *\"Bread Uprising\"*\u2014when baguettes were deemed *suspiciously large* and taxed as *\"luxury items.\"*  \n- **\ud83d\udc8e *Gemstone Shenanigans***: The **9-carat ruby** that turned out to be *dyed cheese*\u2014sparking a duel between two jewelers.  \n- **\ud83d\udc51 *Royal Drama***: The king who *banned sliced bread* because it \"made his sandwiches too easy to eat.\"  \n\nHistory: Where the *stakes are low*, but the *drama is high*. \ud83c\udfad"
