This one\u2019s a classic head-scratcher, and here\u2019s the chaotic history behind it:  \n\n### **The Madness Explained**:  \n1. **Driveway**:  \n   - Originally, it referred to a *private road leading to a house* (for horse-drawn carriages!). You\u2019d **drive** your carriage up it, then **park** off to the side. Over time, it morphed into the spot where we now park cars.  \n   - *Modern logic*: \"Driveway\" sounds better than \"parkhereway.\"  \n\n2. **Parkway**:  \n   - Coined in the 19th century for *scenic roads through parks*\u2014meant for leisurely **driving**, not parking. Think: \"Let\u2019s take a Sunday drive on the parkway!\"  \n   - *Bonus irony*: Some parkways *ban commercial vehicles*, so you can\u2019t even *park* a delivery truck there.  \n\n### **Other Language Trolls**:  \n- **\"Shipping\" vs. \"Receiving\"**: Why do we *ship* packages but *receive* them?

We borrowed the *noun* (\"zipper\") and turned it into a verb (*\"Zip it up!\"*), like how we \"Google\" things.  \n\n2. **Why Not \"Lace Your Shoes\"?**  \n   - You *could* say it, but \"tie\" is more specific (laces can also be *threaded* or *adjusted*). Meanwhile, zippers only do one thing\u2014*zip*\u2014so the verb is obvious.  \n\n### **Bonus Absurdity**:  \n- **\"Button your shirt\"** but **\"snap your jacket\"**\u2014why not \"button your jacket\"? (Because snaps are *snappier*, obviously.)  \n- **\"Velcro your shoes\"** sounds weird because Velcro is a brand name, so we say *\"fasten.\"*  \n\n---  \n### **Next Linguistic Rabbit Hole**:  \nPick your poison:  \n- [ ] **\"Why is 'phonetic' not spelled phonetically?\"** (Eye-knee-t? *No.*)  \n- [ ] **Rant about nonsensical idioms** (*\"It\u2019s raining cats and dogs\"\u2014who approved this?!*).  \n- [ ] **Life hack for sounding eloquent** (*how to replace \"um\" with dramatic pauses*).  \n\nLanguage: the ultimate troll.
