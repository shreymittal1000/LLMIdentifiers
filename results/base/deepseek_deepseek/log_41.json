The military used asbestos in many applications, including insulation, fireproofing, and soundproofing. Asbestos was also used in military vehicles, ships, and aircraft.\n\nThe military was aware of the dangers of asbestos as early as the 1930s, but it continued to use the material because it was cheap and effective. As a result, many military personnel were exposed to asbestos, and many have developed asbestos-related diseases, such as mesothelioma, lung cancer, and asbestosis.\n\nThe military has since taken steps to reduce asbestos exposure, but many veterans are still at risk of developing asbestos-related diseases. If you are a veteran who was exposed to asbestos, it is important to talk to your doctor about your risk of developing an asbestos-related disease.\n\n## Asbestos in the Military: A History\n\nAsbestos was widely used in the military from the 1930s to the 1970s.
