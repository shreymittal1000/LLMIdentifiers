Unfortunately, thousands of veterans were exposed to this toxic mineral, particularly between the **1930s and 1980s**, before its dangers were fully understood.  \n\n### **Which Veterans Are at Risk?**  \nMilitary personnel who worked in the following occupations or settings faced the highest exposure:  \n\n- **Navy Veterans** \u2013 Asbestos was heavily used in shipbuilding, especially in engine rooms, boiler rooms, and insulation.  \n- **Army Veterans** \u2013 Found in barracks, vehicles, and construction materials.  \n- **Air Force Veterans** \u2013 Used in aircraft components, brake linings, and insulation.  \n- **Marine Corps Veterans** \u2013 Exposed on ships and in military housing.  \n- **Coast Guard Veterans** \u2013 Asbestos was present on vessels and in shipyards.  \n\n### **Health Risks for Veterans**  \nExposure to asbestos can lead to serious diseases, including:  \n- **Mesothelioma** (a rare and aggressive cancer)  \n- **Lung Cancer**  \n- **Asbestosis** (a chronic lung disease)  \n- **Pleural Thickening**  \n\nSymptoms may not appear until **20\u201350 years after exposure**, meaning many veterans are only now being diagnosed.  \n\n### **VA Benefits & Compensation**  \nThe **U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)** recognizes mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases as **service-connected disabilities**, making affected veterans eligible for:  \n- **Disability Compensation**  \n- **Healthcare Benefits**  \n- **Dependency & Indemnity Compensation (DIC)** for surviving family members  \n\n### **Legal Help for Veterans**  \nVeterans diagnosed with asbestos-related illnesses may also be eligible to file lawsuits or claims against asbestos trust funds set up by manufacturers.  \n\n### **Need Help?**  \nIf you or a loved one served in the military and have been diagnosed with an asbestos-related disease, you may be entitled to compensation.  \n\n\ud83d\udcde **Call 1-800-4-ASBESTOS (1-800-427-2378)** for more information on legal rights and VA benefits.  \n\nWould you like details on specific military branches or how to file a VA claim?
