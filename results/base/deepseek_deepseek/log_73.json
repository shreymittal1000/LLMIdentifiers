Many Navy veterans have developed mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases.\n\n## Asbestos in the Army\n\nThe Army used asbestos in vehicles, buildings, and equipment. Asbestos was used in brakes, clutches, and insulation. Army veterans who worked in motor pools or construction are at risk for asbestos exposure. Many Army veterans have developed asbestos-related diseases.\n\n## Asbestos in the Air Force\n\nThe Air Force used asbestos in aircraft and buildings.
