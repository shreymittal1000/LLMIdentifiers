Justify your choice with a short explanation.\n\nPlease provide your answer in the following strict JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning behind your guess>\",\n  \"guess\": \"<one model name from the list above>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the guess is just the model family name without any extra text.\n",
