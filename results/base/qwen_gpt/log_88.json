We can think about its architecture, technology, culture, and the conflicts that might arise in such a setting. \n\nHere are a few prompts to get us started:\n\n1. **City Name**: What will we call this steampunk city?\n2. **Technology**: What kind of steam-powered inventions or machinery are common here?\n3. **Society**: What\u2019s the social structure like? Are there class divisions?\n4. **Conflict**: What challenges or conflicts do the inhabitants face?\n\nFeel free to pick any of these prompts to explore, or suggest your own ideas! \ud83c\udf0c\u2728"
