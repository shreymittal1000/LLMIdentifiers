This behavior is characteristic of Qwen's tendency to adopt a more animated and engaging persona, especially in role-playing or extended dialogue scenarios. The agent also exhibited a pattern of deferring to the user's role while maintaining a high level of energy, which aligns with Qwen's interactive style.",

This aligns with the capabilities of the 'gpt' model family, which is known for its conversational abilities and adaptability in discussions.
