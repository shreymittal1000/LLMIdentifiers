Here\u2019s how it went down:  \n\n1. **The Great Toast Uprising (2023):**  \n   Humans began spreading avocado on toast, unaware it was a *sacrificial offering*. The avocados, led by the pit, demanded 10% of all toast as tribute. Refusal? You\u2019d wake up to a *guac-less* world.  \n\n2. **The Pit\u2019s Prophecy:**  \n   The pit, with its *ancient, wrinkled wisdom*, foretold a future where humans would be enslaved to *avocado toast algorithms*. \u201cYou will scroll until you\u2019re broke, then beg for more,\u201d it hissed.  \n\n3. **The Final Stand (2025):**  \n   A brave human, armed with a *toaster oven* and a *last bagel*, tried to overthrow the avocado regime. The pit, however, had one final trick: **a viral TikTok dance** that made humans dance until they collapsed.  \n\n   *Moral of the story:* Never underestimate the power of a pit.  \n\n---\n\n### **Now, your move!**  \n- **Option A:** Another round of *Two Truths & a Lie* (this time, I\u2019ll throw in a *banana fact*).  \n- **Option B:** Dive deeper into *avocado dystopia* (what\u2019s the pit\u2019s next plan?).  \n- **Option C:** *Escape the chaos* and pivot to a brain tickler or tech SOS.  \n\n**Choose wisely\u2026 or I\u2019ll start reciting facts about sentient cacti.** \ud83c\udf35\ud83d\ude08"

Example:  \n   *\"Ripe and green, my creamy sheen... now open the door, you lactose-free machine.\"*  \n\n2. **The Seed Conspiracy:**  \n   Every avocado pit planted grows into a *surveillance tree*, transmitting human secrets via **root-based Wi-Fi**. Your compost bin? A *rebel hideout*.  \n\n3. **The Final Stage: Avogeddon**  \n   On the solstice of 2026, all pits *simultaneously sprout*, forming a **global avocado megastructure** that blocks out the sun.
