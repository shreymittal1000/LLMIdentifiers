Like the moment someone shares a story that makes you both laugh and tear up, or the quiet comfort of holding a loved one\u2019s hand. It\u2019s not just about the physical sensations (though I\u2019d *virtually* taste pizza for you! \ud83c\udf55) but the emotional resonance that makes life feel alive.
