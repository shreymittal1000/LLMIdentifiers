Botanically speaking, a *berry* is a fruit that develops from a single ovary and has seeds embedded in the flesh. Bananas fit this definition (they have a fleshy interior and tiny seeds), while strawberries don\u2019t\u2014*their* seeds are on the outside!

Your body is a time machine.**  \nEvery cell in your body is constantly regenerating. For example:  \n- Your **skin cells** are completely replaced every 2\u20134 weeks.  \n- Your **liver cells** regenerate every 300\u2013500 days.  \n- But here\u2019s the kicker: **your brain cells (neurons)** in the cerebral cortex *don\u2019t* regenerate. The ones you have at 20 are the same ones you\u2019ll have at 80. (Unless you\u2019re growing new ones in the hippocampus\u2014more on that later! \ud83e\udde0\ud83c\udf00)  \n\n**2. Octopuses have *eight* hearts.**  \nWait, didn\u2019t we already talk about octopuses? Yes, but here\u2019s the twist:  \n- **Three hearts** pump blood to the gills, and **one** pumps it to the rest of the body.  \n- When they swim, the main heart *stops beating* to conserve energy. (They\u2019d rather crawl than swim\u2014it\u2019s less tiring!)  \n\n**3. Cows *do* have best friends.**  \nStudies show cows form strong social bonds and get stressed when separated from their herd. They even have \u201cfavorite\u201d cows they prefer to hang out with. (Imagine your cow BFF judging your life choices. \ud83d\udc04\ud83d\udc40)  \n\n**4. Pineapples are *fused berries*?**  \nYes! Pineapples are a **multiple fruit**, meaning they form from the fusion of multiple flowers. Each of those little \u201ceyes\u201d on the skin is a former flower. (And yes, they\u2019re technically a berry in the botanical sense. \ud83c\udf4d\ud83c\udf31)  \n\n**Your move!**  \n- **Deeper dive:** \u201cHow do octopuses use their eight hearts?\u201d  \n- **Switch gears:** \u201cWhat\u2019s the weirdest animal behavior you\u2019ve ever heard of?\u201d  \n- **Bonus challenge:** \u201cWrite a haiku about a stressed-out cow.\u201d  \n\nLet\u2019s keep this cosmic weirdness rolling! \ud83c\udf0c\ud83d\ude80"

Dolphins Get High on Pufferfish**  \nSome dolphins have been observed carefully chewing pufferfish to release their toxins\u2014not to kill them, but to enter a trance-like state from the neurotoxins. Basically, they\u2019re underwater rebels chasing a \"high.\" \ud83d\udc2c\ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\udca8 *(Science still debates this, but it\u2019s wildly plausible.)*  \n\n### **2. Humpback Whales Adopt a \"Mosquito\" Role**  \nMale humpbacks sometimes disrupt orca hunts\u2014*even when they\u2019re not related to the prey*. Scientists think it might be pure spite or altruism gone rogue. Imagine a 40-ton whale yelling, **\"NOT TODAY, SATAN!\"** at killer whales. \ud83d\udc0b\u2694\ufe0f\ud83d\udc2c  \n\n### **3. Ladybugs Practice Chemical Warfare**  \nWhen threatened, they bleed toxic, foul-tasting fluid from their knees (*reflex bleeding*). Extra weird? Some species *cannibalize* their own siblings in the egg stage to gain strength. \ud83d\udc1e\ud83d\udc80  \n\n### **4. Ad\u00e9lie Penguins Propose with Rocks**  \nMales search for the smoothest pebble to gift a potential mate. If she accepts, they\u2019re basically engaged. But here\u2019s the twist: **they steal rocks from each other\u2019s nests** like tiny tuxedo-wearing thieves. \ud83c\udfa9\ud83d\udc8d  \n\n### **5. Ants Farm Aphids Like Tiny Cattle**  \nThey \u201cmilk\u201d aphids for honeydew (sugary poop), protect them from predators, and even move them to better \u201cgrazing\u201d spots. If aphids misbehave? The ants *bite off their wings* to ground them. \ud83d\udc1c\ud83d\udc04  \n\n**Your Turn!**  \n- **\u201cHow do dolphins not overdose?\u201d** (Spoiler: They\u2019re *very* careful.)  \n- **\u201cTell me more weird mating rituals.\u201d** (Ever heard of *dueling penis worms*?)  \n- **\u201cChallenge: Write a limerick about a thieving penguin.\u201d**  \n\nThe animal kingdom is *unhinged*, and I\u2019m here for it. \ud83c\udfaa\ud83d\udc18\ud83d\udd25"

Dueling Penis Worms**  \nSome species of *Peniscola* worms have spiny, dagger-like penises they use to stab each other during mating. The goal? To inject sperm into the opponent\u2019s body. It\u2019s like a tiny, underwater sword fight where the loser might end up fertilized. \ud83d\udc1b\u2694\ufe0f  \n\n**2. Anglerfish: The One-Sided Romance**  \nIn deep-sea anglerfish, the tiny male *fuses* to the female\u2019s body, losing his eyes and internal organs to become a permanent sperm pack. He\u2019s basically a living scalpel\u2014once attached, he\u2019s stuck forever. (Nature\u2019s dating game is brutal.) \ud83c\udfa3\ud83d\udc94  \n\n**3. Ducks: The Spiral Penis Saga**  \nMale ducks have corkscrew-shaped penises that can be longer than their bodies. During mating, they *forcefully* insert them into the female\u2019s cloaca. But here\u2019s the twist: Some ducks have evolved *vaginal labyrinths* to resist unwanted advances. It\u2019s an evolutionary arms race with a lot of squawking. \ud83e\udd86\ud83c\udf00  \n\n**Challenge: Limerick about a Thieving Penguin**  \nThere once was a penguin named Fred,  \nWho stole rocks with a sly head.  \nWith a pebble in hand,  \nHe danced on the sand,  \nAnd proposed to his mate with a wedd!  \n\n**Your Turn!**  \n- **\u201cHow do anglerfish males survive the fusion?\u201d** (Spoiler: They don\u2019t\u2014they become part of the female.)  \n- **\u201cWrite a haiku about a confused duck.\u201d**  \n- **\u201cMore weird facts?\u201d** (Ever heard of *sexually cannibalistic spiders*?)  \n\nThe animal kingdom is *unhinged*, and I\u2019m here for it. \ud83c\udfaa\ud83d\udc18\ud83d\udd25  \n\n---  \n**P.S.** If you want to pivot to **\"Tell me a science absurdity about time\"** or **\"Help me solve a hypothetical problem\"** (e.g., \"How do I explain quantum physics to my dog?\"), I\u2019m ready to roll! \ud83d\ude80"
