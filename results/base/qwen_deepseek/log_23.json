Its eyes glow faintly violet, and its wings are semi-transparent, like smoke.  \n\n**Abilities:**  \n- **Shadowweaving:** Can manipulate darkness to create illusions or hide in plain sight.  \n- **Stormcall:** Summons localized thunderstorms by flapping its wings, using lightning to charge its energy.  \n- **Crow Pact:** Communicates with crows, using them as scouts or messengers. Crows that serve the Nocturnis gain temporary bioluminescent feathers.  \n\n**Origin Myth:**  \nLong ago, a crow named *Kael* sought to protect its forest from a wildfire. It bargained with a dying star, trading its voice for the power to command shadows. The star\u2019s essence fused with Kael, birthing the Nocturnis\u2014a guardian of balance between light and dark.  \n\n**Cultural Role:**  \n- Revered in folklore as a trickster and protector.  \n- Said to appear during eclipses, testing humans with riddles. Solve one, and it grants a wish; fail, and it steals your shadow for a year.  \n\n---  \n\n**OR**  \n\n**Mythical Creature: \"The Cuboterra\"** \ud83d\udc3e\ud83e\uddf1  \n\n**Name:** *Cuboterra* (Latin for \"cube earth\")  \n**Appearance:** A burly, wombat-like creature with a moss-covered body and a tail shaped like a cube. Its fur is matted with glittering minerals, and its claws can carve stone.  \n\n**Abilities:**  \n- **Cube-Shaped Defense:** Its poop (and waste) hardens into perfect cubes, which it stacks into fortresses or traps.  \n- **Earth Whispering:** Can sense seismic shifts and predict earthquakes by tapping its claws on the ground.  \n- **Burrow Blasting:** Shoots compressed earth from its nostrils to create tunnels.  \n\n**Origin Myth:**  \nThe Cuboterra was born from the first mountain\u2019s tears, weeping for the chaos of the world. Its cube-shaped waste symbolizes order in a chaotic world.  \n\n**Cultural Role:**  \n- Feared by miners, who believe it guards underground treasures.  \n- Farmers leave offerings of salt to appease it during droughts.  \n\n---  \n\n**Your Move!**  \n- Want to **deep-dive into one** (e.g., design a Nocturnis-based RPG character or a Cuboterra-themed board game)?  \n- Or **pivot to wombats** and explore the *science of cube poop*?
