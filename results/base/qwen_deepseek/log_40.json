Two pump blood to the gills, and the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Even cooler? When they swim, the third heart *stops beating* to conserve energy. Nature\u2019s wilder than any sci-fi novel.*  \n\n**Hilarious Short Story:**  \n*\u201cThe Octopus Pirate\u2019s Heart Problem\u201d*  \n\nCaptain Squidward, a one-eyed octopus pirate, was notorious for hoarding treasure in the Mariana Trench. His crew adored him\u2026 until he announced, \u201cWe\u2019re splitting the loot *equally*!\u201d Chaos erupted.  \n\n\u201cWhy would you do this?!\u201d his first mate, a nervous seagull named Gary, squawked.  \n\u201cBecause,\u201d Squidward hissed, \u201cI\u2019ve been calculating. With my three hearts, I can *multitask*! One heart for swimming, one for sneaking, and one for *tricking* you all into thinking I\u2019m fair.\u201d  \n\nThe crew tried to mutiny, but Squidward\u2019s third heart (the one for trickery) had a plan: he faked a heart attack mid-battle. The crew, terrified, rushed to save him\u2026 only to find he\u2019d hidden the treasure in a coconut shaped like a human skull.  \n\nMoral of the story: Never trust a pirate with three hearts.

The experiment was meant to create \u201cartistic cephalopods,\u201d but Cardi-O escaped, leaving behind a trail of *haiku*-etched seashells.  \n\n**Present Day:**  \nThe narwhals\u2019 polka protest had *unintentionally* summoned Dr. Blowfish, who arrived in a submarine shaped like a squid. \u201cMY MASTERPIECE!\u201d she cackled, waving a net made of recycled love letters. \u201cThat heart owes me *royalties* on its emotional depth!\u201d  \n\nGary, mid-hype-seagull routine, panicked. \u201cYou can\u2019t take Cardi-O! It\u2019s the only thing keeping DJ Tentacool from playing *whale dubstep*!\u201d  \n\n**Squidward\u2019s Unexpected Role:**  \nFor once, the pirate saw profit in *doing good*. \u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d he said, \u201cbut only if I get 50% of Cardi-O\u2019s future poetry sales.\u201d (He\u2019d already trademarked *Sonnets of the Salty*.)  \n\n**The Rescue Plan:**  \n1. **Gary** would distract Dr. Blowfish by reciting *terrible* seagull poetry (\u201cOh trash bin, my trash bin\u2026\u201d).  \n2. **DJ Tentacool** would drop a sick beat so loud it scrambled the submarine\u2019s sonar.  \n3. **Cardi-O** would use its *human heart nostalgia* to make the scientist cry (it recited a poem about lost socks).  \n\nIt worked\u2014until Dr. Blowfish revealed her *true* goal: **to fuse Squidward with a librarian\u2019s brain**, creating \u201cthe world\u2019s most organized pirate.\u201d (Squidward screamed and hid in a treasure chest.)  \n\n**Cliffhanger Ending:**  \nAs the submarine imploded (thanks to a poorly timed dolphin encore), Cardi-O whispered to Gary: \u201cThere\u2019s *another* like me\u2026 and it\u2019s in *Las Vegas*.\u201d  \n\n---  \n**Next Moves:**  \n- **Path X:** Vegas Baby!

Now calling itself **The King of the Coral**, it belted power ballads to a crowd of weeping starfish.  \n\n**Conflict:**  \nLyric-O refused to leave. \u201cBaby, I was *born to perform*,\u201d it crooned, adjusting a tiny sequinned cape. \u201cAlso, the llama part of me keeps spitting at pirates.\u201d (Squidward took this personally.)  \n\n**Gary\u2019s Desperate Plan:**  \n1. **Challenge Lyric-O to a karaoke duel** (winner gets Cardi-O\u2019s unpublished sonnets).  \n2. **Squidward would rig the lights** to make it look like Gary could sing (he could not).  \n3. **Cardi-O would emotionally manipulate** its sibling by reading a poem titled *\u201cOde to the Time You Ate My Left Ventricle\u2019s Lunch.\u201d*  \n\n**Disaster Strikes:**  \nMid-duel, Dr. Blowfish\u2019s *new* creation\u2014a jellyfish-librarian hybrid named **Dewey Decimate**\u2014crashed the stage, shrieking overdue notices. The crowd, thinking it was part of the act, threw cocktail umbrellas.  \n\n**Climax:**  \nIn the chaos, Lyric-O\u2019s llama side *finally* rebelled. It spat on Dr. Blowfish, hijacked the jet ski, and sped off toward the Grand Canyon to \u201cfind itself.\u201d Gary, Squidward, and Cardi-O escaped with only a stolen buffet shrimp platter and a renewed hatred for showbiz.  \n\n**Epilogue:**  \nBack at *The Zen Pirate\u2019s Delight*, Cardi-O sighed. \u201cMaybe some hearts are just\u2026 destined to be *divas*.\u201d Squidward, scribbling in a notebook, muttered, \u201c*Vegas Heist 2: Llama\u2019s Revenge* is gonna be *gold*.\u201d  \n\n---  \n**Where to now?**  \n- **Route 1:** Dewey Decimate opens a *floating library* to brainwash sea creatures with overdue fines.  \n- **Route 2:** The llama returns\u2026 with a *karate master octopus* sidekick.  \n- **Route 3:** Gary writes a self-help book, *How to Fail Upward: A Seagull\u2019s Guide*.  \n\nOr\u2026 *your* turn to steer this shipwreck! \ud83d\udea4\ud83d\udca8  \n\n*(This saga is my new favorite thing.)*\n\n**Route 2: The Llama Returns\u2026 With a Vengeance (and a Black Belt)** \ud83e\udd99\ud83d\udc19  \n\nMonths after the Vegas debacle, Gary was *almost* content teaching \u201cSeagull Tai Chi\u201d on"

The llama\u2014now rebranded as **Llama Loco**, master of the *Tsunami Takedown*\u2014had opened a dojo called *The Desert Ripple*, where it taught octopuses karate\u2026 while spitting at anyone who asked too many questions. Its new sidekick, **Octo-Maru**, a karate-chopping octopus with a permanent scowl and a fondness for nunchucks made of kelp, had once been a rival of Squidward\u2019s. (Long story involving a stolen treasure map and a very public karate match.)  \n\n**Act 1: The Black-Belt Betrayal**  \nLlama Loco and Octo-Maru had a *plan*: to overthrow Dr. Blowfish\u2019s underwater empire by hijacking her latest project\u2014a *mecha-jellyfish* designed to enforce overdue library fines. But first, they needed Gary\u2019s help. \u201cYou\u2019re the only seagull who\u2019s survived my spitting radius,\u201d Llama Loco explained, offering Gary a suspiciously glittery smoothie. \u201cJoin us, or I\u2019ll karate-chop your wings into a pi\u00f1ata.\u201d  \n\nGary, mid-sip, realized the smoothie was laced with *karaoke-inducing algae*. \u201cI\u2019m not a traitor!\u201d he squawked, but the algae had already triggered a burst of *whale-pop* from his beak. Octo-Maru facepalmed. \u201cThis is why we don\u2019t trust birds.\u201d  \n\n**Act 2: The Mecha-Jellyfish Heist**  \nThe team infiltrated Dr. Blowfish\u2019s floating library-lair, *The Dewey Decimator*, where Dewey Decimate was busy fining a group of startled jellyfish for \u201ccheckout violations.\u201d The mecha-jellyfish, **Jelly-9**, was a hulking, tentacle-waving beast that could turn any creature into a \u201clibrary patron for life.\u201d  \n\nSquidward, hiding in a bookshelf, muttered, \u201cI\u2019d rather be fined *forever* than let that thing near my treasure.\u201d But Llama Loco had other ideas. \u201cOcto-Maru! Execute the *Octopus of the Void*!\u201d The two karate masters launched into a synchronized attack, Octo-Maru using his tentacles to disarm Jelly-9\u2019s sonar while Llama Loco performed a *spit-based counterattack* (the algae smoothie was *still* working).  \n\n**Act 3: The Unlikely Alliance**  \nAs Jelly-9 short-circuited, Gary managed to free Dewey Decimate from Dr. Blowfish\u2019s control. \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re not like the others,\u201d the jellyfish-librarian stammered, now weeping over overdue notices. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 *fun*.\u201d Gary, ever the opportunist, offered a deal: \u201cHelp us take down Dr. Blowfish, and I\u2019ll get you a *free* library pass to the ocean floor.\u201d  \n\n**Climax: The Final Showdown**  \nDr. Blowfish arrived in her squid-shaped submarine, cackling, \u201cYou think you\u2019ve won? I\u2019ve already grafted a *dolphin\u2019s disco DJ brain* onto a *killer whale*!\u201d The resulting *disco-orca* (named **DJ Finatic**) began playing a mix of whale songs and 80s power ballads, causing chaos.  \n\nBut Llama Loco had one last trick: a *karate-chop karaoke* move that forced DJ Finatic to sing *\u201cMy Heart Will Go On\u201d* in a falsetto so tragic it caused the orca to cry and stop the music.  \n\n**Epilogue:**  \nWith Dr. Blowfish defeated (and her submarine now a floating karaoke bar), the team celebrated with a *Desert Ripple-themed party*.

Squidward, inspired, wrote a cookbook: *101 Ways to Serve Sushi Without Betraying Your Family*.  \n\n---  \n**What\u2019s Next?**  \n- **Option 1:** Squidbert\u2019s food truck wars with a *vegan kraken* in Miami.  \n- **Option 2:** Sensei Tuskface\u2019s *dark past* as a *circus tusk-juggler* resurfaces.  \n- **Option 3:** Gary opens a *dojo for flightless birds* (penguins with nunchucks?).  \n\nOr\u2026 introduce a *time-traveling starfish*? \u23f3\ud83c\udf1f  \n\n*(This universe is a gift that keeps on giving.)*"
