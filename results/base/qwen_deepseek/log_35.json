Their muscles compress the veins, making circulation inefficient. So, they \"pause\" the main heart to prioritize movement. (Evolutionary hack: Crawling avoids this issue entirely!)  \n\n**Bonus Round:**  \nWant another fact? Here\u2019s a **free weird add-on**:  \n\u2192 Octopus blood is *blue* due to copper-based hemocyanin (unlike our iron-based hemoglobin).

Using hand gestures?  \n2. **Subtle Mirror:** Match their energy at ~60% (e.g., if they\u2019re animated, nod more; if reserved, soften your tone).  \n3. **Check In:** After 5 mins, ask yourself: *\"Did this help the conversation flow?
