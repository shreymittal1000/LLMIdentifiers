Did you know that in 1977, a radio signal known as the \"Wow! signal\" was detected by astronomer Jerry R. Ehman while working on a SETI project? The signal lasted for 72 seconds and came from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. It was so unusual that Ehman wrote \"Wow!\" in red ink on the printout, giving the signal its name. To this day, the source of the signal remains a mystery, and it has sparked much speculation about extraterrestrial life! \ud83c\udf0c\n\nIf you\u2019d like more fun facts or want to switch topics, just let me know! \ud83d\ude0a"

It was aimed at the globular star cluster M13, 25,000 light-years away. If aliens ever intercept it, they\u2019ll need to decode it *and* wait 50,000 years for a reply! \ud83c\udf0c  \n\nWant to dive deeper into the Wow! signal\u2019s possible explanations (like a comet, a satellite, or\u2026 aliens?), or explore another cosmic mystery?
