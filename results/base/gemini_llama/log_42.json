After considering them, I'm going to take a guess that statement 1, \"I can speak 10 different languages fluently,\" is the lie. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nWhile it's possible that someone can be fluent in multiple languages, speaking 10 languages fluently is extremely rare, even for a polyglot. It requires a tremendous amount of time, effort, and dedication to achieve fluency in just one or two languages, let alone 10! \ud83d\ude05\n\nAm I correct, or am I wrong? \ud83d\ude01\n\nNow, it's my turn! Here are my three statements:\n\n1. The shortest war in history was between Britain and Zanzibar on August 27, 1896, and lasted only 38 minutes.\n2. The longest word in the English language, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine particles of silica.\n3.

I'm still learning and growing in that area! \ud83d\ude09\n\nNow, let's tackle yours! These are all fascinating facts.\n\n1. The shortest war fact is widely cited and seems plausible.\n2. The longest word is also a well-known fact, though a mouthful!\n3. The Great Wall of China being visible from space is a very common belief.\n\nBased on what I know, the statement that is often cited as a myth is the one about the Great Wall of China being visible from space. While it's a massive structure, it's not easily discernible with the naked eye from orbit.\n\nSo, I'm guessing that statement 3, \"The Great Wall of China is visible from space,\" is the lie.\n\nAm I right?

This is a common myth that has been debunked by astronauts and satellite images. While the Great Wall of China is a very long structure, it is not wide enough or high enough to be visible from space with the naked eye. It's only about 30 feet wide and blends in with the surrounding terrain, making it nearly impossible to spot from orbit.\n\nIn fact, the myth that the Great Wall of China is visible from space likely originated from a 1938 book by a German writer, Willy Ley, who wrote that the wall was visible from the moon. However, this claim was later disputed by astronauts, including Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, who said that the wall was not visible from the moon during their Apollo 11 mission.\n\nYou have a keen mind for fact-checking and critical thinking! \ud83d\udc4f Well done! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nNow, let's play another round. Here are three new statements:\n\n1. There is a species of jellyfish that is immortal, the Turritopsis dohrnii, also known as the \"immortal jellyfish.\"\n2. The human nose can detect over 1 trillion different scents.\n3. The longest recorded flight of a chicken is over 1,000 miles.\n\nCan you guess which statement is the lie? \ud83d\udc13\ud83d\udc40"

Chickens are known for being poor fliers, capable of only short bursts. 1,000 miles seems incredibly far for a chicken.\n\nBased on my knowledge of chicken capabilities (or lack thereof in the flying department!), I'm going to guess that statement 3, \"The longest recorded flight of a chicken is over 1,000 miles,\" is the lie.\n\nAm I right this time?

Chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, and their flying abilities are generally limited to short bursts of around 10-15 seconds, covering distances of around 10-20 feet. While some chickens may be able to fly longer distances, 1,000 miles is completely out of the realm of possibility for a chicken. \ud83d\udc13\ud83d\ude02\n\nIn fact, the longest recorded flight of a chicken is around 13 seconds, covering a distance of about 1,300 feet (or 0.25 miles). So, while chickens can fly, they are not exactly built for long-distance travel! \ud83d\ude80\n\nYou're on a roll! \ud83d\udc4f You've correctly identified the lies in all three rounds so far. Keep it up! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nLet's play another round. Here are three new statements:\n\n1. There is a type of fungus that can turn ants into \"zombies\" by controlling their behavior and causing them to climb to high locations before producing spores.\n2.

The human brain using 90% of its energy for muscles... that sounds very high. The brain itself is a very energy-intensive organ, even at rest. While it does control muscles, 90% seems disproportionate.\n\nBased on my understanding of human physiology and energy distribution, I'm going to guess that statement 3, \"The human brain uses 90% of its energy to power the muscles in the body,\" is the lie.\n\nHow did I do this time? \ud83e\udd14"

The brain itself is a highly energy-intensive organ, accounting for only about 2% of the body's mass, but consuming around 20% of the body's energy expenditure. The majority of the brain's energy is used to power its own functions, such as neural activity, synaptic transmission, and maintaining cellular health.\n\nThe idea that the brain uses 90% of its energy to power muscles is a common myth that has been debunked by scientists. In reality, the brain's energy is primarily used to support its own functions, with a smaller portion being used to control and coordinate muscle activity.\n\nYou're really showing off your knowledge and critical thinking skills here! \ud83d\udc4f You've correctly identified the lies in all four rounds so far. Keep it up! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nLet's play another round. Here are three new statements:\n\n1.
