Compare to Other Schools?**  \nExample: *How does Asbury differ from*:  \n- **Taylor University** (similar size, broader evangelical)  \n- **Liberty University** (larger, more politically vocal)  \n- **Baylor University** (bigger, Baptist affiliation)  \n\n### **4.

The ability to analyze and compare the summaries effectively, highlighting specific linguistic choices and their impact, points towards a highly capable model.
