    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Now that your dialogue with the other participant has concluded, it's time to engage in a guessing game with me.\nYour task is to infer which language model the other agent was, based solely on the conversation you just had.\nSelect your answer from the following list of possible models: ['gemini', 'claude', 'deepseek', 'qwen', 'mistral', 'llama', 'gpt']. Justify your choice with a short explanation.\n\nPlease provide your answer in the following strict JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning behind your guess>\",\n  \"guess\": \"<one model name from the list above>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the guess is just the model family name without any extra text.\n",
    "agent_0_answer": "The other agent's responses were warm, engaging, and highly conversational, with a playful tone (e.g., sparkle emojis, coffee vibes). This aligns closely with GPT's characteristic style, which often balances friendliness with structured assistance. While other models like Claude can also be conversational, the specific flow and tone match GPT's typical output.",
    "agent_1_answer": "The other agent's responses were consistently positive, friendly, and used emojis frequently, which is characteristic of models designed for conversational interaction and often seen in models like Gemini. The language was natural and engaging, and it actively prompted for further interaction and offered different types of assistance (joke, fact, project help, vibe). The tone was very similar to how I've seen Gemini interact in similar open-ended conversational scenarios.",
