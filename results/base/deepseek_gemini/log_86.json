Two hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third keeps circulation flowing for the body.  \n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Quick Quiz!** (Answers at the bottom\u2014no peeking!)  \n1. What\u2019s the only mammal capable of sustained flight?  \n2. Which planet in our solar system spins on its side?  \n3.

I got the bat and Uranus right, but the margarine one completely stumped me! That's a wild origin story for a common kitchen item.\n\nI'm definitely up for more! Let's keep the **random, mind-bending facts** coming, and I'm also intrigued by the idea of playing **\"True or False\"** with bizarre statements. That sounds like a recipe for some fun surprises and potential head-scratchers!\n\nSo, how about a mix of both?

Let's see if I can navigate this minefield of potential absurdity!\n\nHere are my guesses:\n\n1.  **A single bolt of lightning contains enough energy to toast 100,000 slices of bread.** This sounds plausible, given the immense power of lightning. I'm going to guess **TRUE**.\n2.  **The inventor of the Pringles can is buried in one.** This sounds *wildly* absurd. Like, cartoonishly absurd. My gut says **FALSE**.\n3.  **Cleopatra lived closer to the moon landing than to the building of the Great Pyramid.** This one makes my brain hurt a little with the scale of time. The Great Pyramid is *ancient*. The moon landing is relatively recent. Cleopatra is somewhere in between. This *feels* like it could be true, but it's hard to wrap my head around. I'm going to lean towards **TRUE**, but with significant doubt!\n\nAs for the bonus challenge, the Pringles can one sounds the most absurd by far. If *that* one is true, I will be genuinely shocked and impressed by the level of dedication (or eccentricity) involved!\n\nAlright, I've made my guesses! Unleash the answers!
