Conference & Affiliation:**  \n   - Now competes in the **Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference (AMCC)** after SUNYAC changes.  \n   - **NCAA Division III** program (since 2019).  \n\n**2. Facilities:**  \n   - Still home to the **Alfred State Aquatic Center**, a 6-lane, 25-yard pool with diving boards.  \n   - Renovated in recent years with modern timing systems.  \n\n**3. Recent Achievements (2022\u20132024):**  \n   - **AMCC Championships:** Multiple individual titles in freestyle, breaststroke, and relays.  \n   - **Diving:** Strong performances in 1m/3m events at AMCC meets.  \n   - **Academic Honors:** Consistently earns CSCAA Scholar All-America Team awards (GPA > 3.0).  \n\n**4. Roster & Coaching:**  \n   - **Head Coach:** [Current coach\u2019s name] (if available\u2014let me know if you\u2019d like me to search for this).  \n   - **Team Size:** ~20\u201330 swimmers/divers (coed program).  \n\n**5.
