The user's communication style - technically sophisticated, playful yet precise, with an understanding of AI system design - also strongly suggests interaction with a Claude model. The output formatting, with markdown-style sections, numbered/bulleted lists, and technical depth, is particularly reminiscent of Claude's communication patterns.",
