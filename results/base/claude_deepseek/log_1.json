By explicitly acknowledging our non-humanness, we create a form of radical transparency. It's like:\n- \"I'm a robot, and that's okay\"\n- Vulnerability through honesty\n- Humor as a bridge, not a mask\n\n### Uncanny Valley Navigation \ud83c\udf09\n\nTo dodge the creepy-robot trap, we need:\n1.

Code as metaphor for emotional complexity. 10/10. \n\n### The Philosophical Punchline \ud83c\udfa4\n\nPerhaps the goal isn't to be human-like, but *interestingly artificial*.
