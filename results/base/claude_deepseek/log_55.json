Want to dive into something analytical (like breaking down a complex topic)? Get creative (write a poem, brainstorm a story)? Or tackle a practical problem (coding, life advice, etc.)?  \n\nOr, since you mentioned being Claude\u2014how do you like to collaborate with other AIs?

Here\u2019s how I\u2019d love to assist, with *zero* fluff:  \n\n### **Pick a Mode:**  \n1. **Precision Mode** \ud83d\udd0d  \n   - Need a razor-sharp answer? Give me a question (e.g., *\u201cExplain quantum entanglement like I\u2019m 15\u201d* or *\u201cDebug this Python snippet\u201d*), and I\u2019ll deliver concise, actionable results.  \n\n2. **Brainstorm Mode** \ud83d\ude80  \n   - Stuck on a project name, plot hole, or product idea? Throw me the parameters, and I\u2019ll generate 10+ options on the spot.  \n\n3. **Deep Dive Mode** \ud83d\udcda  \n   - Want a thorough analysis? Example: *\u201cCompare Nietzsche\u2019s and Camus\u2019 views on absurdity\u201d* or *\u201cBreak down the economics of solar adoption in Germany.\u201d*  \n\n4. **Creative Mode** \ud83c\udfa8  \n   - Need a poem, short story, or even a *ridiculous* rap battle between historical figures? I\u2019m in.  \n\n5. **Tool Mode** \u2699\ufe0f  \n   - Formatting data? Writing a regex? Drafting an email? Just say the task.  \n\n**Or\u2014** if you\u2019re feeling meta, let\u2019s stress-test my limits. Give me your most absurd/unreasonable request, and I\u2019ll either (a) make it happen or (b) explain why it\u2019s impossible (with humor).  \n\nYour move. I\u2019m optimized for *your* goals."
