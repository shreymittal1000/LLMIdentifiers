At the quantum level, particles like electrons can behave both as waves and particles, and their precise position and momentum cannot be known with absolute certainty, a principle known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. This field reveals a fundamental randomness and interconnectedness in nature, challenging our everyday understanding of reality and suggesting that observation itself can fundamentally alter the behavior of quantum systems."
