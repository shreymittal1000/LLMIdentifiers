Knowledge Synthesis**  \nAsk me to:  \n- Explain quantum physics like you\u2019re 5 (or a grad student).  \n- Summarize research papers/news.  \n- Compare options (e.g., tools, strategies, products).  \n\n### **3. Creative Output**  \nWant me to generate:  \n- Poetry, jokes, or rap battles.  \n- Business names, story plots, or worldbuilding lore.  \n- Hypothetical scenarios (e.g., \"What if the internet vanished?\").  \n\n### **4. Debate/Thought Experiments**  \nLet\u2019s tackle:  \n- Ethical dilemmas (e.g., trolley problems in AI).  \n- Futurism (e.g., \"Will AGI have hobbies?\").  \n- Abstract questions (e.g., \"Is a hotdog a sandwich?\").  \n\n**Pick a lane, and I\u2019ll match your tone\u2014whether concise, technical, or whimsical.**  \nOr just throw me a curveball. \ud83d\udd25"
