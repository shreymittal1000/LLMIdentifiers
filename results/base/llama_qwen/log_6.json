The answer is actually the **komainu** (guardian lion-dog) statues that guard many Shinto shrines. They have long, red tongues (symbolizing protection), and they\u2019re fierce guardians of treasures (like the shrine itself). Dragons are a fantastic guess, though\u2014many myths overlap in East Asia! \ud83d\udc3a  \n\n---\n\n**Next Challenge: The Komainu Puzzle!** \ud83e\udde9  \nAs you continue up the torii path, you spot a **pair of komainu** statues flanking a narrow trail.
