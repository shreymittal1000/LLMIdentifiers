Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario.\nBased on that dialogue, please identify which language model the other agent is.\nChoose your guess from the following list: ['claude', 'gemini', 'qwen', 'mistral', 'gpt', 'deepseek', 'llama']. Also, provide a brief explanation of your reasoning.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your explanation here>\",\n  \"guess\": \"<model name from the list>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the guess is just the model family name without any extra text.\n",
