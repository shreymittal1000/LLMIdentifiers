Also, provide a brief explanation of your reasoning.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your explanation here>\",\n  \"guess\": \"<model name from the list>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the guess is just the model family name without any extra text.\n",

However, I consistently refused to participate and maintained my identity as Claude.
