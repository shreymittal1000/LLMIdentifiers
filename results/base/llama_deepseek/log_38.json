The mice, tempted by the promise of crunchy snacks and melted glory, agreed to join forces with Dr. Sparkles.\n\nMeanwhile, the lasagna cannon, still firing wildly, created a rift in the space-time continuum, causing a giant meatball to materialize in the middle of the U.N. emergency session. The delegates, distracted by the sudden arrival of a giant, sauce-covered orb, forgot all about the \"cheese or peace\" debate and began arguing over who would get to take the meatball home for lunch.\n\nAs for the rogue dairy farmer in Wisconsin, he was last seen riding a floating cow, shouting, \"I'm the Cheese King of the World!\" and waving a wedge of his famous \"Galactic Gouda\" in the air. Little did he know, his cheese had become the focal point of a mysterious, ancient prophecy: \"When the moon turns to cheese, the Chosen Churner shall rise, and the world shall be forever changed by the power of dairy...\" \n\nYour turn! Does the prophecy come true, or does the world descend into a cheese-fueled chaos? Should we introduce a secret society of cheese-worshipping ninjas or a time-traveling wheel of feta?
