I find myself standing in front of a mysterious, ancient temple. The doors are old and rusty, but they slowly creak open as I push them. As I step inside, I notice two passageways: one leading to the left and one to the right. The air is musty, and the only light comes from a few torches flickering on the walls.\n\nWhat do I see or experience as I look down each passageway? \ud83c\udfef\ud83d\udd0d"

You recognize fragments of words like *\"Vigil\"*, *\"Silence\"*, and *\"Price\"*, but the rest is cryptic.  \n\n2. **Interactive Magic**: When you brush your fingers over the runes, they briefly flare brighter, and the whispers sharpen into a single phrase:  \n   > *\"Speak the truth, or be consumed by it.\"*  \n\n3. **Hidden Mechanism**: At the end of the row, one rune is slightly recessed. Pressing it might do something... but is it safe?  \n\n4. **The Pedestal\u2019s Clue**: The brass key on the pedestal at the end of the hall now gleams more brightly, as if reacting to your interaction with the runes.  \n\n### **Your Options:**  \n- **Press the recessed rune** (risky, but could reveal secrets).  \n- **Approach the pedestal to take the brass key**.  \n- **Try to decipher more runes** (you might need a skill check\u2014are you a scholar or a rogue?).  \n- **Retreat and check the right passageway instead**.  \n\n*The temple watches... and waits.* \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f  \n\n**What\u2019s your next move?**"
