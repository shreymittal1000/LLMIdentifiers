My past is marked by a tragic event: my sister, a brilliant hacker, was killed during a high-stakes data heist. The official story claimed it was an accident, but I've uncovered hints of a larger conspiracy involving the Quantum Energy Division. Now, I use my skills to uncover hidden truths and track down leads in the city's underworld.\n\nI've been searching for a contact who can provide me with classified information about the energy source's true nature and potential connections to my sister's death. A cryptic message from an anonymous source led me to this caf\u00e9, and the rumors about a rogue astrophysicist with valuable data drew me to your booth.\n\n**Scene: The Neon Nook Caf\u00e9 (Continued)**  \n*(I take a seat across from you, my eyes scanning the caf\u00e9 for potential threats or surveillance.

I'm looking for something specific: a dataset related to the Quantum Energy Division's research on the 'Erebus Protocol.'

Perhaps we can discuss the details in a more... secure environment?\"*\n\nWhat's your response, Dr. Vexis?
