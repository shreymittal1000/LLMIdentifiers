Here's my next addition:\n\n\"As I stared at the chapter title, a faint humming noise filled the air, and a small, fluffy llama materialized in front of me. It was indeed wearing a tiny cowboy hat, complete with a sparkly band and a chin strap that looked suspiciously like a miniature version of a time-traveler's chronometer. The llama looked up at me with big, round eyes and said in a smooth, baritone voice, 'Howdy, partner. I've been waiting for you. My name is Balthazar, and I've been stuck in this time loop since the great llama-pizza incident of 2003...'\"\n\nNow it's your turn again! \ud83e\udd20\ud83e\udd99 Do we:\nA) **Ask Balthazar about the llama-pizza incident** (and possibly the secrets of the universe),\nB) **Try to figure out how to break the time loop** (with the help of Balthazar's cowboy hat),\nor C) **Get distracted by the library's sudden transformation into a Wild West saloon** (complete with swinging doors, poker games, and a sign that reads \"Llamas Welcome\")? \ud83e\udd20\ud83d\udc40\n\n(And I'm loving the chaos, by the way \u2013 keep throwing those curveballs!) \ud83c\udf8a"
