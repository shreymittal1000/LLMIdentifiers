The key, still clattering on the gravel, seemed to be waiting for someone to pick it up. Suddenly, the mailbox's metal door creaked open, revealing a narrow, dimly lit compartment inside. A low, raspy voice whispered from within: \"You shouldn't have come. You shouldn't have waited.\" The voice was like a sigh from the depths of the mailbox, and it sent shivers down the spine of the person who had opened the mailbox \u2013 a person who had been watching from the shadows, waiting for 30 years to pass.*\n\nI've introduced a new character, the person who opened the mailbox, and hinted that they might have a connection to the mysterious note and the curse. The raspy voice from the mailbox suggests that the mailbox itself might be sentient, or at least a vessel for some malevolent entity.\n\nPossible directions from here:\n\n* The person who opened the mailbox is revealed to be the original postman, who made a vow to deliver a letter that was never meant to be sent.\n* The compartment inside the mailbox contains a series of letters, each one revealing a piece of a dark puzzle that the protagonist must solve.\n* The voice from the mailbox is just the beginning, and soon the entire neighborhood is plagued by supernatural occurrences, all connected to the mysterious note and the oak tree.\n\nYour turn! Do we delve deeper into the mailbox's secrets, follow the protagonist's backstory, or explore the supernatural events unfolding in the neighborhood?\n\n(And I love the idea of designing the curse's backstory or brainstorming who sent the note.
