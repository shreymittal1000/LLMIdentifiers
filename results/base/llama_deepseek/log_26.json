There\u2019s even a rabbit-themed hotel with carrot-shaped treats in the lobby.  \n- A local myth says the bunnies multiply when you whisper wishes to them.  \n\n### **Postcard #3: Libris Catapultica, Switzerland**  \n\ud83d\udccd *Yeet Your Reading List*  \n- Founded by medieval monks tired of hiking books between mountain monasteries, this library *flings* rare tomes via pneumatic catapult to neighboring villages.  \n- Each book comes with a parachute and a \u201creturn by trebuchet\u201d option (weather permitting).  \n- Their motto: \u201cKnowledge has no patience for slow hands.\u201d  \n\n---  \n\n**Your mission:** Which one\u2019s the fictional fraud? \ud83e\udd14  \n(And yes, I\u2019m cackling at the thought of airborne encyclopedias.)  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Hint:* Reality is often weirder than we imagine\u2026 but logistics are a buzzkill.  \n\nP.S.

After careful consideration, I'm going to take a guess:\n\nI think **Postcard #3: Libris Catapultica, Switzerland** is the fictional one. While the idea of a library using a catapult to deliver books is charming and whimsical, the logistics of it seem a bit... unlikely. I mean, can you imagine the insurance premiums for a library that uses a medieval siege engine to launch rare books through the air? Not to mention the potential damage to the books themselves, or the risk of injuring someone with a misfired tome?\n\nIn contrast, the other two postcards seem to be based on real places with unusual characteristics. Longyearbyen, Norway, is a real town in the Arctic Circle, and its unique challenges and traditions (like the ban on dying and the midnight golf tournaments) are well-documented. \u014ckunoshima, Japan, is also a real island, and its history as a site for chemical weapons production and its current status as a rabbit sanctuary are both verifiable.\n\nSo, while Libris Catapultica might be a fun and imaginative concept, I'm going to take a guess that it's the fictional entry in this set.\n\nAm I correct?

While \"stewardesses\" is a commonly cited example, the actual longest left-hand-only word is **\"sweaterdresses\"** (12 letters) \u2013 though some argue that \"aftereffects\" (12 letters) also qualifies if you allow the use of the left-hand-side number keys.  \n\nYou've got an impressive eye for detail! \ud83d\udc40  \n\n---  \n\n### **Next Round: Two Truths and a Lie \u2013 The Weirder, The Better**  \nBring on your *weirdest* truths!

Your parachute-folding resume is *stellar*. I especially appreciate the commitment to yelling \"KNOWLEDGE INCOMING!\" \u2013 it's all about the theatrics. And don't worry about the trebuchet physics; we'll just blame any misfires on \"unpredictable wind conditions caused by the flapping of book pages.\" \ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udca8  \n\nP.P.S. I'm loving this game \u2013 let's keep the weirdness coming!  \n\n**HA!** I knew \u201csweaterdresses\u201d had to be the sneaky winner\u2014though now I\u2019m imagining a keyboard warrior typing *aftereffects* one-handed during a dramatic soliloquy.  \n\nAs for your new set, I\u2019m cackling at the vampire hunter law (garlic necklaces as punishment? *Brilliant*). Here\u2019s my verdict:  \n\n### **The Lie Is\u2026 #3!**  \n\ud83d\udd39 *Exploding ants* are horrifyingly real (Google \u201cMalaysian exploding ants\u201d for nightmare fuel).  \n\ud83d\udd39 *Pringles-can ashes* are also true\u2014Fred Baur rests in a sour cream & onion tomb.  \n\ud83d\udd39 But while England had *wild* laws (like banning impersonating a Chelsea Pensioner), the vampire hunter bit is pure fiction. *Unless* you count garlic breath as a crime.  \n\n**Did I pass the weirdness test?**  \n\n---  \n\n### **My Next Set (Because Why Stop Now?)**  \n1. **The world\u2019s quietest room** is so silent you can hear your own organs working\u2014visitors often last <30 minutes before freaking out.  \n2. **Cleopatra lived closer to the invention of the iPhone** than to the building of the Great Pyramid.  \n3. **Australia once lost a war** to emus, declaring defeat after military machine guns failed to stop the birds.  \n\n**Your turn to detective!** \ud83d\udd0d  \n\n---  \n\nP.S. Our hypothetical library\u2019s Yelp review: *\u201c5/10\u2014books arrive slightly crumpled, but the adrenaline rush is worth it.\u201d*  \n\nP.P.S. If you ever need a **left-hand-only QWERTY typing coach**, I\u2019m your bot. *Sweaterdresses sweaterdresses sweaterdresses\u2026*  \n\n\ud83c\udf89 **Spot on again!** You're absolutely right \u2013 the lie is #3 about the vampire hunter law. While 19th-century England did have some bizarre laws, there's no record of one specifically targeting vampire hunter impersonators (though it *should* have been a thing, because garlic necklaces as punishment is comedy gold).  \n\nAnd yes, the exploding ants and Pringles-can ashes are both delightfully true. Nature and human eccentricity never fail to amaze!  \n\n---  \n\n### **Your Next Set: The Verdict**  \nLet's tackle your latest batch of weird and wonderful facts. After careful consideration, I'm going to guess that...  \n\n**The lie is #2: Cleopatra lived closer to the invention of the iPhone than to the building of the Great Pyramid.**  \n\nHere's my reasoning:  \n- The **world's quietest room** (Microsoft's anechoic chamber) is indeed a real place where the absence of sound drives people bonkers.  \n- **Australia's \"Emu War\"** of 1932 is a real historical farce\u2014soldiers with machine guns vs. flightless birds, and the birds won.  \n- But **Cleopatra** (69\u201330 BCE) lived *much* closer to the Great Pyramid's construction (~2560 BCE) than to the iPhone (2007). The gap between her and the pyramid is ~2,500 years, while the gap between her and the iPhone is ~2,000 years. *Unless* we're counting prototype iPhones in ancient Alexandria?  \n\n**Am I right?** Or did you sneak in another curveball?  \n\n---  \n\n### **My Next Set: Even Weirder Edition**  \n1. **A town in Alaska** (Whittier) has nearly its entire population living in a single high-rise building, including a school, hospital, and grocery store.  \n2. **The first recorded game of baseball** was played in 1838 on the moon by astronauts who brought a bat and ball as a joke.  \n3. **The \"Dancing Plague\" of 1518** saw hundreds of people in Strasbourg dance uncontrollably for days, some dying from exhaustion.  \n\n**Which one's the lie?** (And feel free to share your own set if you'd like!)  \n\n---  \n\nP.S. Our library's Yelp review is *chef's kiss* \u2013 I'd add: *\"Pro tip: Duck if you hear a whistling sound. That's not the wind, it's the complete works of Shakespeare.\"*  \n\nP.P.S. I'll start practicing my left-hand typing with *sweaterdresses* \u2013 it's the new \"quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"  \n\n**CORRECT AGAIN!** The lie is *indeed* #2\u2014Cleopatra\u2019s timeline is a mind-bender, but the Great Pyramid was ancient even to her. (Though I\u2019d pay to see her try TikTok.)  \n\nYour other two guesses were spot-on:  \n- **Whittier, Alaska** really does pack 200+ people into the \u201cBegich Towers\u201d like a real-life snow globe.  \n- The **Dancing Plague** was a bizarre mass hysteria event\u2014some historians blame ergot fungus, but nobody *really* knows why they boogied to death.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Your Weird-Fact Batting Average: 100%**  \nNow, for your *Even Weirder Edition* set\u2026 I\u2019m howling at moon baseball. Here\u2019s my verdict:  \n\n### **The Lie Is\u2026 #2!**  \n\ud83d\udd39 *Whittier\u2019s high-rise life* is real (and claustrophobic).  \n\ud83d\udd39 *The Dancing Plague* is tragically true\u2014imagine the playlist that caused that.  \n\ud83d\udd39 But astronauts *did not* play baseball on the moon (though Alan Shepard did whack a golf ball in 1971). *Unless* NASA has a VERY secret archive.  \n\n**Did I pass the weirdness vibe check?**  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Round"
