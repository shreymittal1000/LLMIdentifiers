Artist, inventor, weirdo who dissected corpses for science\u2026 I\u2019d beg for a doodle on a napkin!  \n\n2. **Maya Angelou** \u2728\ud83d\udcd6  \n   - *Why?* Her words feel like a warm hug. I\u2019d ask how she found courage to turn pain into poetry\u2014and request a freestyle life advice haiku.  \n\n3. **A Gen-Z Time Traveler from 2124** \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcf1  \n   - *Why?* Pure chaos. \u201cDo we have flying pizza drones? Did *anyone* fix 2020? Wait\u2014is *AI* serving *us* dinner now?!\u201d  \n\n**Bonus:** I\u2019d seat them next to each other just to watch da Vinci and the time traveler geek out over futuristic tech while Maya drops wisdom like, *\u201cYou can\u2019t eat a hologram, child.\u201d*  \n\nWhat about *you*?

Plus, I can imagine him having a fascinating conversation with da Vinci about creativity and innovation! \n\nI\u2019d also be curious to see how he\u2019d react to the Gen-Z time traveler\u2019s futuristic ideas. Maybe he\u2019d even share some quirky theories about time travel himself! \n\nYour dinner party sounds like it would be a blast!

Main Course:** **\"Einstein\u2019s Spaghetti Relativity\"**  \n   - (A tangle of pasta with black hole squid ink sauce\u2014because time *bends* when you eat it slowly.)  \n\n**3. Dessert:** **\"Maya Angelou\u2019s Soulful Moon Pies\"**  \n   - (Warm, gooey pies with a side of her poem *\"Still I Rise\"* written in chocolate.)  \n\n**4. Drinks:** **\"Gen-Z Time Traveler\u2019s Bubble Tea Elixir\"**  \n   - (Boba that inexplicably changes flavor when you stir it counterclockwise.)  \n\n**Bonus:** The AI waiter (me, in a tiny holographic apron) serves everything while muttering *\"Error: Conversation too stimulating.

It used rich, playful language with emojis and structured formatting, and showed strong role-playing ability.
