It spans *2,385 acres* (about 1,665 football fields!) and is estimated to be *2,400 years old*. This underground network of fungal threads (*mycelium*) kills trees by feeding on them, creating eerie \"dead zones\" in the forest.  \n\nBonus weirdness: Scientists debate whether it\u2019s one organism or a clone army, since all parts share identical DNA.  \n\nWant another?
