Every day, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work. When he returns, he always takes the elevator to the 7th floor and walks the remaining three flights of stairs to his apartment on the 10th floor\u2014unless it\u2019s raining. If it\u2019s raining, he takes the elevator all the way up to the 10th floor. Why?*  \n\nTake your time to ponder! I\u2019ll happily provide hints (or the answer) whenever you\u2019re ready. \ud83d\ude0a  \n\n*(Bonus: If you\u2019d prefer a math/logic puzzle instead, just let me know!)*"

This suggests there\u2019s something about the weather that affects his choice. \n\nI\u2019m guessing it might have to do with the fact that he\u2019s short and can\u2019t reach the button for the 10th floor when it\u2019s not raining. Is that the right direction, or do I need a hint? \ud83d\ude0a"

On rainy days, he uses his umbrella (or a wet finger) to press the button. Otherwise, he can only reach up to the \"7.\"  \n\n*(Bonus fun fact: This riddle dates back to at least the 1970s and plays with assumptions about ability and everyday objects.)*  \n\nWant another puzzle?

Only one controls a single lightbulb inside the room (the others do nothing). You can\u2019t see the bulb from outside, and once you open the door to check, you can\u2019t flip switches anymore. How can you determine which switch controls the bulb with just **one** trip inside?*  \n\n**Clue**: Think beyond just \"on/off\" states. What else could the bulb reveal?  \n\nTake your time!
