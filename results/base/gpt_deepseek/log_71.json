The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three.\n\nWhen vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies.\n\nThe House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.\n\n### Section 3 - The Senate\n\nThe Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote.\n\nImmediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.\n\nNo Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.\n\nThe Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.\n\nThe Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United States.\n\nThe Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.\n\nJudgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.\n\n### Section 4 - Elections, Meetings\n\nThe Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.\n\nThe Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.\n\n### Section 5 - Membership, Rules, Journals, Adjournment\n\nEach House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House may provide.\n\nEach House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.\n\nEach House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal.\n\nNeither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.\n\n### Section 6 - Compensation\n\nThe Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.\n\nNo Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.\n\n### Section 7 - Revenue Bills, Legislative Process, Presidential Veto\n\nAll Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.\n\nEvery Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.\n\nEvery Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.\n\n### Section 8 - Powers of Congress\n\nThe Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;\n\nTo borrow Money on the credit of the United States;\n\nTo regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;\n\nTo establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States;\n\nTo coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures;\n\nTo provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United States;\n\nTo establish Post Offices and post Roads;\n\nTo promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings"

It grounded authority in *popular sovereignty* (unlike European monarchies), though initially excluding women, enslaved people, and non-landowners.  \n\n---  \n### **Next Steps:**  \nWould you like to:  \n- Explore how the Preamble has been cited in landmark cases (e.g., *Jacobson v. Massachusetts*, 1905, on vaccines and welfare)?  \n- Compare its ideals to the realities of 1787 (e.g., slavery compromises)?  \n- Move to **Article I\u2019s structure (bicameralism)** or **Congress\u2019s powers**?  \n\nLet me know your priority!"

Slavery & the Three-Fifths Compromise**  \n- **Preamble\u2019s promise**: \"Liberty\" and \"Justice\" for all.  \n- **Reality**: The Constitution *protected slavery* (Art. I, Sec. 9 barred banning slave imports until 1808; Fugitive Slave Clause in Art. IV).  \n- **Three-Fifths Clause (Art. I, Sec. 2)**: Enslaved people counted as 3/5 of a person for congressional representation, boosting slaveholding states\u2019 political power.  \n\n**Key Irony**: The Preamble\u2019s \"more perfect Union\" required compromising with slavery\u2014a tension that led to the Civil War.  \n\n#### **2. Exclusion of Marginalized Groups**  \n- **Voting rights**: Only white, male property owners could vote in most states.  \n- **Native Americans**: Called \"Indians not taxed\" (Art. I, Sec. 2), excluded from representation.  \n- **Women**: Absent from the political process until the 19th Amendment (1920).  \n\n**Modern Reflection**: The 14th Amendment (1868) and Voting Rights Act (1965) later sought to align practice with the Preamble\u2019s ideals.  \n\n#### **3. State vs. Federal Power**  \n- **Preamble\u2019s goal**: \"Domestic Tranquility\" via federal strength.  \n- **Reality**: States retained vast power (e.g., slavery laws), leading to conflicts like *Dred Scott* (1857) and the Civil War.  \n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters Today**  \nThe Preamble\u2019s aspirational language has been used to *expand* rights over time (e.g., civil rights movements citing \"Justice\" and \"Liberty\"), even as the original text fell short.  \n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**  \nWant to explore:  \n- **A) How amendments (like the 13th, 14th, 19th) addressed these gaps?**  \n- **B) Move to Article I\u2019s structure (bicameralism) and how it reflected these compromises?**  \n- **C) Compare the Preamble\u2019s ideals to modern debates (e.g., voting rights, federal power)?**  \n\nYour turn!"

Board* (1954) and LGBTQ+ rights (*Obergefell*, 2015).  \n  - **Due Process Clause**: Extended Bill of Rights to states (selective incorporation).  \n\n#### **3. 15th (1870) & 19th (1920) Amendments: Expanding Suffrage**  \n- **Original Contradiction**: Voting limited to white male property owners.  \n- **15th Amendment**: Prohibited racial voting discrimination (but Jim Crow laws circumvented it until 1965).  \n- **19th Amendment**: Granted women\u2019s suffrage (though Black women faced barriers until the Voting Rights Act).  \n\n#### **4. 24th Amendment (1964) & Voting Rights Act (1965)**  \n- **Original Contradiction**: States controlled voting rights, enabling poll taxes and literacy tests.  \n- **24th Amendment**: Banned poll taxes in federal elections.  \n- **VRA**: Federal oversight to combat racial discrimination in voting.  \n\n#### **5. Ongoing Debates**  \n- **Preamble\u2019s \"General Welfare\"**: Used to justify New Deal programs, but contested today (e.g., healthcare, student debt relief).  \n- **\"Justice\" in Criminal Justice Reform**: Mass incarceration and policing debates reflect unmet promises.  \n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters**  \nThese amendments show the Constitution as a *living document*\u2014interpreting the Preamble\u2019s ideals progressively, though imperfectly.  \n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**  \nWant to:  \n- **A) Dive into a specific amendment\u2019s legal impact** (e.g., 14th in *Brown v.
