Things like kites or sails need wind, but they don\u2019t \"speak\"... unless...  \n\n**Lightbulb moment!** \ud83d\udca1 Is it... an **echo**?  \n- *Speaks* when you shout (but no mouth).  \n- \"Hears\" your voice to repeat it (but no ears).  \n- Needs wind (or really, sound waves) to \"live\"!  \n\n...Wait, or is it a **whistle**? Nope, that has a \"body.\" Hmm.  \n\n**Final guess:** It\u2019s an **echo**! (But if I\u2019m wrong, hit me with the answer\u2014I\u2019m curious!) \ud83d\ude06  \n\n*Alternatively*: Could it be a **wind chime**?

It \"speaks\" when sound waves bounce back, \"hears\" by receiving sound, and is often associated with open spaces where the wind carries sound. \n\nYou did an amazing job piecing it together!
