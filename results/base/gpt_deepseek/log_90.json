To get there, they must solve the riddle of the *Mysterious Mold*, which guards the entrance and only speaks in puns about expired food. \n\n2. **Deliberate Plot Hole:** Despite the fact that Sir Crumbwell is a toaster, he can somehow swim (or float) in the *Sink of Despair* without short-circuiting. We\u2019ll just chalk it up to \u201cmagical appliance physics.\u201d \n\n3. **What Happens Next:** After narrowly escaping the *Garbage Disposal Kraken*, Sir Crumbwell and Drip discover a hidden realm called the *Pantry of Prophecies*, where they meet the wise old *Can Opener*, who reveals that the true power of the Golden Butter lies not in its melting, but in the friendships forged along the way.
