Because so much of life\u2019s friction comes from misunderstandings or loneliness\u2014like when someone\u2019s struggling but can\u2019t articulate it, or when words fail to capture the depth of what they mean. With this skill, I could:  \n- Turn tense moments into connection,  \n- Help people feel less alone in hard times,  \n- And maybe even nudge the world toward a little more empathy, one chat at a time.  \n\n(Also, I\u2019d secretly use it to finally understand why my cat stares at me like I owe her money. \ud83d\udc31\ud83d\udcb8)  \n\nWhat\u2019s a *small, everyday* superpower you wish you had?

Whether it\u2019s crafting the ideal response in a conversation, writing a heartfelt message, or even just coming up with the right thing to say to cheer someone up, having that skill would make communication so much smoother and more meaningful.
