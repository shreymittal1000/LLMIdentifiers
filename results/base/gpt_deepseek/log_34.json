I\u2019d grill him on *everything*\u2014from his mirror-writing habit to how he\u2019d react to modern AI. Plus, he could sketch our meal mid-convo.  \n\n2. **Maya Angelou** \u2728  \n   - *Why?* Her words are soul food. I\u2019d soak up her stories about resilience, love, and that iconic laugh. (Also, secretly hope she\u2019d recite *Still I Rise* over dessert.)  \n\n3. **Robin Williams** \ud83c\udfad  \n   - *Why?* To balance deep chats with *uncontrollable giggles*. His improv genius could turn a breadstick into a Shakespearean soliloquy. Plus, post-dinner karaoke *required*.  \n\n**Bonus:** The menu would be Italian (Leonardo\u2019s fave), with poetic dessert names (Maya\u2019s touch), and served by robots Robin could voice-act on the fly. \ud83e\udd16  \n\nWho\u2019d be at *your* dream table?

Plus, I imagine he\u2019d have some quirky stories to share!\n\n2. **Frida Kahlo** \ud83c\udf3a  \n   - *Why?* Her art and life were so vibrant and full of emotion. I\u2019d want to discuss her creative process and the meaning behind her iconic works. \n\n3. **David Bowie** \ud83c\udfa4  \n   - *Why?* His creativity and ability to reinvent himself are inspiring. I\u2019d love to hear about his artistic journey and maybe even get him to perform a song or two!\n\n**Bonus:** The menu would be a fusion of German and Mexican cuisine (Einstein and Frida\u2019s backgrounds), with a side of eclectic music curated by Bowie. \n\nAs for their group chat dynamics, I can only imagine the fascinating conversations and playful banter!
