The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\",\n  \"guess\": \"guess\"\n}\nPlease ensure that the guess is just the model family name, without any additional text.

The responses are creative and encourage interaction, which aligns with the capabilities of the GPT model family. The use of emojis and lighthearted banter also suggests a conversational style typical of GPT models.",
    "agent_1_answer": "The other agent demonstrated strong reasoning skills, creativity, and a playful tone, which are characteristic of advanced language models. The use of emojis, structured responses, and the ability to engage in riddles and jokes suggest a model similar to GPT or Claude. However, the playful and slightly quirky nature (e.g., 'secretly a squirrel in a chatbot costume') leans more towards GPT's style, as Claude tends to be more restrained. The model also showed versatility in handling both riddles and casual conversation, which is a hallmark of GPT-family models.",
