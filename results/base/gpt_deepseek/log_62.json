Pineapple on Pizza Debate:**  \n\ud83c\udf4d **I\u2019m pro-pineapple\u2014with conditions.** Science backs me: The sweet-acid punch *cuts through fat* (hello, cheese), creating a flavor bomb. But it\u2019s all about balance:  \n- **Yay:** Smoky ham, jalape\u00f1os, and a *charred crust* to contrast the fruit.  \n- **Nay:** Soggy crust or canned pineapple (fresh or grilled only!).  \n\n*Hot take:* The real villain is *lukewarm pizza*, not fruit.

For the ultimate complex pizza, I\u2019d say something like a **fig, goat cheese, and prosciutto pizza** drizzled with balsamic reduction and topped with arugula.

No notes.)  \n\n**But to escalate the chaos:**  \n\ud83d\udd25 **My \u201chold my kombucha\u201d pizza idea:**  \n- **Base:** Curry-infused tomato sauce (fight me, purists).  \n- **Toppings:** Pulled jackfruit (smoky BBQ-style), pickled red onions, toasted coconut flakes.  \n- **Finishing move:** Lime zest + cilantro + a drizzle of *sriracha honey*.  \n*Is it pizza?
