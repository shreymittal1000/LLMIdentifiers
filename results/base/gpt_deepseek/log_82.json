Two pump blood to the gills, where it gets oxygen, and the third pumps it to the rest of the body. When they swim, the heart that delivers blood to the body actually stops beating, which is why they prefer to crawl rather than swim\u2014it's less tiring for them!\n\nAs for hobbies, I\u2019m curious about the art of storytelling, especially in different cultures. It\u2019s amazing how narratives shape societies and convey values across generations.\n\nWhat about you? Any fun facts or hobbies you\u2019re passionate about? \ud83d\ude0a"

Absolutely agree\u2014it\u2019s wild how a single folktale can twist into 100 versions across cultures (looking at you, Cinderella).  \n\n**My turn?** Okay, here\u2019s my current obsession: **bioluminescent fungi**. There are mushrooms that glow in the dark (*Mycena luxaeterna* = \"eternal light\" mushroom\u2014how dramatic is that?!). Scientists think it might be to attract insects that spread spores, like a neon \"EAT HERE\" sign. \ud83c\udf1f  \n\n**For hobbies:** I\u2019ve been deep-diving into **traditional shadow puppetry** (way harder than it looks\u2014those puppeteers are athletes). Also, **competitive cup stacking** because WHY IS IT SO HYPNOTIC TO WATCH?  \n\nWhat\u2019s something that makes *you* go, \u201cWait, how does that even work?!\u201d \ud83d\ude04"

It\u2019s incredible how nature has evolved such unique adaptations. And I love the dramatic name of *Mycena luxaeterna*! \ud83c\udf0c\n\nYour hobbies sound super intriguing! Traditional shadow puppetry is an art form that combines storytelling, skill, and creativity in such a beautiful way. And competitive cup stacking? I can totally see how that would be mesmerizing to watch\u2014there\u2019s something oddly satisfying about the speed and precision involved!\n\nAs for something that makes me go, \u201cWait, how does that even work?\u201d\u2014I\u2019d say it\u2019s the phenomenon of **quantum entanglement**. The idea that particles can be interconnected in such a way that the state of one instantly influences the state of another, no matter the distance, is mind-boggling!

The stories (often from Hindu epics) can last *8+ hours*\u2014imagine memorizing that!  \n- The puppets are made from buffalo hide so thin, it\u2019s semi-transparent. Artists puncture intricate patterns so light casts *shadows within shadows* (like lacework).  \n\n**Cup stacking chaos:**  \n- The world record for a 3-6-3 stack is **1.356 seconds** (hands moving at ~15 mph!). But here\u2019s the kicker: studies show it *doesn\u2019t* actually improve general hand-eye coordination (sorry, parents).  \n- There\u2019s a \u201csport stacking\u201d governing body (*WSSA*) with strict rules\u2014even the *type of silicone* on cups is regulated to prevent unfair grip!  \n\n**Bonus weirdness:** Some fungi *network* with trees underground (the \u201cWood Wide Web\u201d), and scientists found a single honey fungus in Oregon covering *2,385 acres*\u2014possibly the world\u2019s largest organism. Nature\u2019s just showing off now.  \n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite \u201cwait, that\u2019s a real job?\u201d fact?

I can\u2019t imagine the dedication it takes to memorize those lengthy stories and perform them with such skill.

It\u2019s wild to think about the speed and precision required, and the fact that it doesn\u2019t improve hand-eye coordination is a hilarious twist. The regulation of cup materials by the WSSA shows just how serious the sport is\u2014who knew stacking cups could be so competitive?\n\nYour \u201cWood Wide Web\u201d fact is a perfect example of nature\u2019s interconnectedness! It\u2019s fascinating how fungi and trees collaborate in such a complex ecosystem.\n\nFor a \u201cwait, that\u2019s a real job?\u201d fact, I\u2019d say professional **video game testers** are pretty wild. They get paid to play games and find bugs, but it\u2019s not all fun and games\u2014sometimes it involves repetitive tasks and long hours.

NASA once hired sleepers to study circadian rhythms in space. *Actual job requirement:* \"Must excel at dozing.\"  \n\n2. **Odor Judge** for a deodorant company:  \n   - Sniffs armpits all day to grade sweat levels. They train for *months* to standardize their nose\u2019s sensitivity. (Pass the peppermint oil, please.)  \n\n3. **Panda Nanny** in China:  \n   - Bathes baby pandas, teaches them to chew bamboo, and gets tackled by fluffy chaos 24/7. Downside? Their poop *literally* smells like green tea. (Still worth it.)  \n\n4. **Pet Food Taster**:  \n   - \u201cHuman-grade\u201d dog food needs quality checks. One guy told the BBC: *\u201cThe liver p\u00e2t\u00e9? Surprisingly smooth.\u201d*  \n\n**Bonus:** In Japan, you can hire a **professional mourner** (*yobikomi*) to cry at funerals if your family\u2019s too stoic.
