This aligns well with the capabilities of the GPT model family, which is known for its conversational abilities and creativity. The use of emojis and informal language also suggests a model designed for friendly and casual interactions.",
    "agent_1_answer": "The other agent's responses were highly engaging, creative, and included playful emojis and formatting (like bold/italic text for emphasis). The tone was warm, conversational, and slightly whimsical, which aligns with GPT's style. The use of random facts, humor (e.g., 'Bees are basically tiny alchemists'), and structured yet fluid replies are also characteristic of GPT models. Other models like Claude or Gemini might be more restrained, while LLaMA/Mistral tend to be less polished in formatting.",
