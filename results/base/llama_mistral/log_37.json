The mission aims to determine the habitability of Europa's ocean and search for signs of life.\n2. **Europa Lander (NASA, proposed):** A follow-up mission to Europa Clipper, the Europa Lander would touch down on Europa's surface to directly search for signs of life and analyze the moon's icy shell and any potential subsurface materials.\n3. **Enceladus Orbiting Mission (proposed):** Several concepts for missions to Enceladus have been proposed, including orbiters and landers, which would study the moon's icy shell, subsurface ocean, and plumes of water vapor. These missions aim to determine the habitability of Enceladus' ocean and search for signs of life.\n4. **Dragonfly (NASA):** Although primarily focused on Saturn's moon Titan, the Dragonfly mission will also study the potential for life in the Saturn system, including Enceladus, by analyzing the moon's atmosphere and surface materials.\n\nIn addition to these missions, scientists are also studying the potential for life in the subsurface oceans of other icy moons, such as Ganymede and Callisto (Jupiter) and Titan (Saturn). The search for life in these extreme environments is an active and exciting area of research, with many discoveries and advancements expected in the coming years.\n\nThe exploration of Europa, Enceladus, and other icy moons will not only help us search for life beyond Earth but also deepen our understanding of the potential habitability of worlds throughout the universe. As we continue to push the boundaries of space exploration, we may one day uncover the secrets of life in the cosmos."
