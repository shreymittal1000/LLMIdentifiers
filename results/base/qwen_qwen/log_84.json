Bananas fit this perfectly! \ud83c\udf4c  \n- **Strawberries are impostors**: Their \"seeds\" (those tiny dots on the outside) are actually the true fruit, while the red fleshy part is the receptacle.

They have a single ovary and a fleshy interior. \ud83e\udd51  \n- **Tomatoes**? Berries too!

So sharks outlived them by **200 million years** and survived **four mass extinctions**!  \n\n**Bonus brain-blast**:  \n- **Shark skin** is covered in tiny tooth-like scales called **dermal denticles**, which reduce drag and make them super-efficient swimmers.  \n- **Some sharks** (like the Greenland shark) can live **over 400 years**\u2014they\u2019re basically the **immortal legends** of the sea. \ud83e\udd88\u2728  \n\nWant to explore **shark survival secrets**, or shall we pivot to the **Morse code parrot**? \ud83e\udd9c (Imagine training a parrot to squawk *\u201c... --- ...\u201d* to signal for help in a storm. \ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f)  \n\nOr\u2026 **another surprise**?

The salt concentration is about **0.9%**, similar to seawater! \ud83c\udf0a  \n- **Evolutionary link**: This might be a throwback to when our ancestors were **aquatic**\u2014millions of years ago, early life forms relied on saltwater for survival. Even now, our bodies use salt to **balance fluids and fight infections** in the eyes.  \n- **Emotional tears**: When you cry from **emotions** (sadness, joy, frustration), your tears have **higher levels of stress hormones** (like cortisol) and **leucine enkephalin** (a natural painkiller). So crying might actually help you feel better! \ud83d\ude22\u2728  \n\n**Bonus weirdness**:  \n- **Tears of joy vs. sorrow**: The composition changes slightly depending on the emotion. For example, **emotional tears** have more **prolactin** (a hormone linked to bonding and stress relief).  \n- **Cats and dogs**: They don\u2019t cry *emotional* tears, but they *do* produce salty tears to **lubricate their eyes**. So humans are the only ones with \"sentimental salinity.\" \ud83d\udc3e  \n\nWant to dive deeper into **tear chemistry**, or shall we pivot to the **Morse code parrot**? \ud83e\udd9c (Picture a parrot squawking *\u201c... --- ...\u201d* to alert sailors to a storm\u2014*\u201cSOS\u201d* in avian code! \ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f)  \n\nOr\u2026 **another surprise**?

This causes your nose to run\u2014*literally*! \ud83e\uddca  \n- **Mucus joins the party**: Emotional crying also triggers the **parasympathetic nervous system**, which increases mucus production in your nose. So it\u2019s not just tears\u2014it\u2019s a **tear-mucus cocktail**! \ud83e\udd64  \n- **Evolutionary quirk**: This system helps **flush out irritants** (like dust or allergens) from your eyes and nose.
