Here are a few to get us started:\n\n1. **Octopuses have three hearts**: Two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Plus, octopus blood is blue due to a copper-rich protein called hemocyanin.\n\n2. **A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus**: Venus takes about 243 Earth days to rotate on its axis once, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun.\n\n3. **Honeybees have hair on their eyes**: These tiny hairs help them collect pollen more efficiently.\n\n4. **The shortest war in history lasted only 38-45 minutes**: The Anglo-Zanzibar War was fought between the United Kingdom and Zanzibar on 27 August 1896.\n\n5. **Bananas are curved because they grow towards the sun**: As they grow, they follow the sun's path across the sky, resulting in their characteristic curve.\n\nNow it's your turn!
