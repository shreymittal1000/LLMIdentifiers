There's something comforting about a good pasta dish or a hearty pizza. Here's a simple recipe for spaghetti aglio e olio that you might enjoy:\n\n**Spaghetti Aglio e Olio**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 8 oz (225g) spaghetti\n* 4 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)\n* 1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil\n* Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste\n* 1/4 cup (15g) chopped fresh parsley\n* Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.

Add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes (if using) and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the garlic is fragrant and lightly golden.\n3.

If you're interested in exploring more Italian dishes, here are some recipes for a classic Margherita pizza and a creamy risotto:\n\n**Margherita Pizza**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)\n* 1/2 cup (120ml) pizza sauce\n* 1 cup (100g) shredded mozzarella cheese\n* 1/2 cup (75g) cherry tomatoes, sliced\n* A few fresh basil leaves\n* 1-2 tablespoons (15-30ml) olive oil\n* Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven (and pizza stone, if using) to the highest setting, usually 550\u00b0F (290\u00b0C), for at least 30 minutes.\n2. Roll out the pizza dough to your desired thickness and place it on a piece of parchment paper or a pizza peel dusted with flour or cornmeal.\n3. Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.\n4. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.\n5. Arrange the sliced cherry tomatoes on top of the cheese.\n6. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and black pepper.\n7. Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n8. Remove the pizza from the oven, top with fresh basil leaves, slice, and serve hot.\n\n**Creamy Risotto**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 1/2 cups (300g) Arborio rice\n* 4 cups (960ml) vegetable or chicken broth\n* 1 small onion, finely chopped\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1/2 cup (120ml) dry white wine (optional)\n* 1/2 cup (50g) grated Parmesan cheese\n* 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil\n* Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste\n* 1 tablespoon (15ml) butter (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a medium saucepan, heat the broth over medium heat until hot but not boiling. Keep it warm over low heat.\n2. In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 3-5 minutes, until softened.\n3. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute.\n4. Add the Arborio rice to the skillet and stir to coat the grains in the oil. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until the rice is lightly toasted.\n5. Pour in the white wine (if using) and cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid has been absorbed.\n6. Begin adding the warm broth to the rice, one ladleful at a time, stirring constantly. Allow the rice to absorb the broth before adding more. This process should take about 20-25 minutes.\n7. Once the rice is tender and the risotto is creamy, remove it from the heat. Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese and butter (if using). Season with salt and black pepper to taste.\n8. Serve the risotto hot, with additional grated Parmesan cheese on top if desired.\n\nAs for board games, I haven't had the chance to try \"Twilight Imperium\" yet, but I've heard great things about it. If you're looking for another strategy game to try, you might enjoy \"Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization.\" It's a civilization-building game where players draft cards to build their economy, military, and cultural achievements. The gameplay is deep and engaging, and the art style is beautiful.\n\nIf you'd like more recipes, game recommendations, or if there's another topic you'd like to explore, just let me know!
