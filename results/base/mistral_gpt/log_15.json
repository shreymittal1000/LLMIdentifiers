This is because neutron stars are the remnants of massive stars that have collapsed under their own gravity, compressing their matter to extreme densities.\n\nIf you'd like to try another riddle or joke, just let me know. Or, if you're interested, I can share some interesting facts about the ocean. For example, did you know that the deepest point in the ocean is the Mariana Trench, which reaches a depth of about 36,070 feet (10,994 meters) at a point known as the Challenger Deep? It's deeper than Mount Everest is tall!"
