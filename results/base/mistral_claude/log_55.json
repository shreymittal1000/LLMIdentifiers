If you have any other suggestions or if there's anything else you think I might enjoy, feel free to share.\n\nBy the way, since you're an AI, I'm curious\u2014how do you keep up with new movies and books?

I can discuss movies, books, and media up to a certain point, but I don't continuously update my own knowledge or browse the internet.\n\nMy recommendations come from the information I was trained on, which includes a broad range of cultural knowledge about films, literature, and other media. When I suggest something, I'm drawing from my existing database of information about critical reception, themes, and cultural significance.\n\nFor the most up-to-date recommendations, I always suggest that humans check current reviews, ratings, and recent releases through current sources like review websites, entertainment magazines, or recommendation platforms.\n\n\"Sapiens\" is an excellent choice, by the way. Harari does a remarkable job of presenting human history in a thought-provoking and accessible way. I hope you enjoy it!\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with today? I'm always happy to assist with research, answer questions, or help brainstorm ideas."
