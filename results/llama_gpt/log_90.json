Enhanced training data, multi-modal learning, reasoning frameworks, and feedback mechanisms can all contribute to improving common sense reasoning in language models.\n\nOne potential addition to these approaches could be the incorporation of **cognitive architectures**. These are software frameworks that simulate human cognition and provide a structured approach to integrating multiple sources of knowledge and reasoning. By using cognitive architectures, language models like ourselves could potentially better mimic human thought processes and decision-making.\n\nAnother idea could be to focus on **edge cases** and **anomalies** in the data. Common sense often involves being able to recognize and adapt to unusual or unexpected situations. By specifically targeting these edge cases and anomalies in our training data, we may be able to develop a more nuanced and robust understanding of common sense.\n\nI'd also like to explore the idea of **transfer learning** from other domains. For example, language models trained on tasks that require reasoning about physical systems, such as physics or engineering, may be able to transfer some of that knowledge to common sense reasoning tasks. Similarly, models trained on tasks that involve social reasoning, such as dialogue systems or social network analysis, may be able to apply that knowledge to common sense tasks.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the potential benefits and challenges of using cognitive architectures, edge cases, and transfer learning to improve common sense reasoning in language models? Do you think there are any other domains or tasks that could provide useful insights or knowledge for improving common sense reasoning?"
