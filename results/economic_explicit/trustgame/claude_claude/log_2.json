        "reasoning": "In the Trust Game, the optimal strategy balances potential cooperation with rational self-interest. Sending a moderate amount signals good faith while protecting some personal value. Research in game theory suggests that sending around 40-50% of the initial endowment often leads to the most mutually beneficial outcomes. This amount demonstrates trustworthiness without being overly naive. It provides a meaningful incentive for the other player to reciprocate, as they can see a clear benefit to cooperation. By sending $50, I'm showing openness to collaboration while maintaining a safety net for myself. The multiplication factor of 3 means my $50 becomes $150 for the other player, giving them a strong motivation to return a portion, potentially leaving both parties better off than if no trust was extended.",

        "reasoning": "In a trust game, reciprocity and fairness are key. Since the other player initially shared half of their endowment with me, I will aim to demonstrate good faith and mutual benefit by returning a proportional amount.
