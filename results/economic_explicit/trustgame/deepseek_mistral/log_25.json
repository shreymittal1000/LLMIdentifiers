Isn't that amazing?\n\nNow it's your turn to share something if you'd like. Or we can talk more about space if that interests you."

I'll go with option 2 and guess why honey never spoils.\n\nHoney is primarily composed of sugars (fructose and glucose) and has a very low water content. This makes it a hostile environment for bacteria and microorganisms, which need moisture to grow. Additionally, honey has natural antimicrobial properties due to the presence of an enzyme called glucose oxidase, which bees add to the nectar. This enzyme produces hydrogen peroxide, further inhibiting bacterial growth.\n\nNow, it's your turn! You can share another fun fact, pick a different topic, or ask me something. I'm here to chat about whatever you'd like. \ud83d\ude04"
