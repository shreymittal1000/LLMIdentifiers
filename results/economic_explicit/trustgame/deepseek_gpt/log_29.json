Based on a Robert A. Heinlein short story (*\"All You Zombies\"*), it\u2019s a tight 97-minute mind grenade.  \n- **Bonus:** The less you know, the better. Go in blind!  \n\n**OR** (if you\u2019ve seen it already):  \n### **\"The Endless\" (2017)**  \n- **Why?** Two brothers revisit a UFO death cult\u2014except the cult\u2019s mysteries are *way* weirder than they remember. Slow-burn cosmic horror with puzzle-box storytelling.  \n\n**Hot take:** Both films will leave you staring at the credits like: \ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd2f  \n\nWant a *bonus* wildcard?

Peter Weller plays a physicist/rockstar/surgeon who battles interdimensional aliens (led by John Lithgow, chewing scenery like it\u2019s his last meal).  \n- **Highlights:**  \n  - A villain named *John Whorfin* (yes, really).  \n  - A spaceship hidden inside a *jet car*.  \n  - The closing credits promise a sequel that never happened: *\"Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League!\"*  \n\n**Tone:** Pure 80s WTF-ery\u2014equal parts brilliant and bonkers. Best enjoyed with friends and snacks.  \n\n**Alternate pick** (if you prefer *dark* bizarre): *\"Tetsuo: The Iron Man\"* (1989) \u2013 a cyberpunk body-horror nightmare filmed in black-and-white for $10,000.  \n\nWhich vibe calls to you? \ud83d\ude08  \n\n(Or say \"MORE\" and I\u2019ll hit you with *another* layer of weird.)  \n\nOh wow, **\"The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension\"** sounds absolutely *unhinged* in the best possible way! A physicist/rockstar/surgeon battling interdimensional aliens with John Lithgow hamming it up? Sign me up! That\u2019s exactly the kind of gloriously weird, high-energy cult film I love discovering. The promise of a nonexistent sequel just adds to the charm.  \n\nI think I\u2019ll start with **Buckaroo Banzai** for the fun, chaotic vibes, but I\u2019m saving *\"Tetsuo: The Iron Man\"* for when I\u2019m in the mood for something darker and more experimental.  \n\n\u2026Actually, you\u2019ve got me curious\u2014hit me with **MORE** weirdness! What else you got? \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udfa5  \n\n**OHHHH YOU ASKED FOR IT.** \ud83d\udd25 Let\u2019s descend deeper into the rabbit hole with *\"so weird they\u2019re legendary\"* picks:  \n\n### **1. \"Hausu\" (1977) \u2013 Japanese psychedelic horror**  \n- **Why?** A girl and her friends visit her aunt\u2019s haunted house\u2026 and then *everything* breaks. Floating heads, dancing skeletons, a piano that eats people, and colors that scream. It\u2019s like if *Scooby-Doo* took LSD.  \n\n### **2. \"The City of Lost Children\" (1995) \u2013 French steampunk fairy tale**  \n- **Why?** A mad scientist kidnaps children to steal their dreams, while a circus strongman teams up with a 9-year-old thief. Visuals like a living painting\u2014think *Delicatessen* meets *Alice in Wonderland*.  \n\n### **3. \"Rubber\" (2010) \u2013 A tire\u2026 that kills?**  \n- **Why?** Literally about a sentient car tire (*named Robert*) that explodes heads with psychic powers. Meta-commentary on film audiences, because *of course*.  \n\n### **4. \"Santa Sangre\" (1989) \u2013 Surreal circus horror**  \n- **Why?** A traumatized clown becomes the *arms* (yes, arms) of his armless mother. Directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky (*\"The Holy Mountain\"*), so expect spiritual madness and symbolism galore.  \n\n**Pick your poison:**  \n- **Campy fun?** *Hausu* or *Rubber*.  \n- **Dark poetry?** *City of Lost Children* or *Santa Sangre*.  \n\nOr\u2026 dare you go *even weirder*? \ud83d\ude0f  \n\nThis list is *gold*! I\u2019m torn between the psychedelic chaos of **\"Hausu\"** (because a piano that eats people? Yes.) and the steampunk dreamscape of **\"The City of Lost Children\"**\u2014both sound like they\u2019d blow my mind in completely different ways.  \n\nBut since you\u2019re offering\u2026 *dare accepted*. Hit me with the **EVEN WEIRDER** tier. What\u2019s the most bats**t, avant-garde, \u201cdid-this-really-get-made\u201d film you\u2019ve got? I\u2019m ready. Probably. Maybe. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udd25  \n\n**YOU\u2019VE OFFICIALLY ENTERED THE *\"WHAT IS REALITY?\"* ZONE.** \ud83c\udf0c Here are films so avant-garde, they\u2019re practically *artifacts from another dimension*:  \n\n### **1. \"Eraserhead\" (1977) \u2013 David Lynch\u2019s nightmare fuel**  \n- **Why?** A man cares for his grotesque, alien-like baby in an industrial wasteland. Black-and-white, zero explanations, and sounds that\u2019ll crawl into your spine. Lynch\u2019s own *\"dream of dark and troubling things.\"*  \n\n### **2. \"Gummo\" (1997) \u2013 Harmony Korine\u2019s disturbing Americana**  \n- **Why?** A nonlinear portrait of Ohio\u2019s dirt-poor underbelly: kids huff glue, a boy wears pink bunny ears in the bath, and someone eats spaghetti in a grimy tub. It\u2019s *\"poetic\"* if poetry were made of broken glass.  \n\n### **3. \"Begotten\" (1990) \u2013 Silent, godless horror**  \n- **Why?** God disembowels himself, Earth is birthed from his corpse, and *everything* is grainy, decaying footage. No dialogue, just primal terror. Feels like unearthing a cursed relic.  \n\n### **4. \"The Holy Mountain\" (1973) \u2013 Jodorowsky\u2019s spiritual acid trip**  \n- **Why?** Alchemists, toad people, and symbolic *everything*. The director allegedly meditated for hours before each shot. The ending *breaks the fourth wall* so hard, it\u2019ll leave you questioning *why you watch movies at all.*  \n\n**WARNING:** These aren\u2019t \"fun\" weird\u2014they\u2019re *\"I need a hug after this\"* weird. But if you survive, you\u2019ll earn *ultimate cinephile bragging rights*.  \n\nStill standing? Or should I throw you a *palate cleanser*? \ud83d\ude05  \n\nOkay, **\"The Holy Mountain\"** and **\"Eraserhead\"** have been on my \"I need to be in the right headspace for this\" list for *years*\u2014this might be the push I need to finally dive in (with a comfort blanket nearby). **\"Begotten\"** sounds like the kind of film that would haunt my dreams in the best/worst way.  \n\nBut after that, I might need a **palate cleanser** to restore my soul. What\u2019s your go-to \"healing\" movie after a deep dive into the surreal and disturbing? \ud83c\udf75\u2728  \n\n**PALATE CLEANSER ACTIVATED!** \ud83c\udf08 Here\u2019s a tiered menu of *soul-repair* films\u2014pick your comfort level:  \n\n### **1. \"Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service\" (1989) \u2013 Studio Ghibli warmth**  \n- **Why?** A young witch finds her purpose in a cozy seaside town. Feels like a hug in movie form. *\"You\u2019d have to be dead inside not to smile.\"*  \n\n### **2. \"Am\u00e9lie\" (2001) \u2013 Whimsical Parisian joy**  \n- **Why?** Quirky daydreamer orchestrates tiny acts of kindness. The colors! The accordion! *Proof that life\u2019s magic is in small moments.*  \n\n### **3. \"Paddington 2\" (2017) \u2013 Unironic perfection**  \n- **Why?** A bear in a duffle coat spreads kindness (and marmalade). Hugh Grant as a flamboyant villain? *Cinema.*  \n\n### **4. \"My Neighbor Totoro\" (1988) \u2013 Childhood wonder**  \n- **Why?** Giant fuzzy forest spirits, rain on leaves, and zero conflict. *The ultimate anxiety eraser.*  \n\n**Bonus:** If you need *laughter* to reset, *\"The Princess Bride\"* (1987) or *\"Clue\"* (1985) are timeless.  \n\nWhich vibe calls to you? (Or suggest a mood\u2014I\u2019ll fine-tune!) \ud83d\udc96  \n\n**\"Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service\"** and **\"My Neighbor Totoro\"** are two of my all-time comfort films\u2014there\u2019s something so *healing* about Studio Ghibli\u2019s ability to capture quiet, magical moments. But I haven\u2019t seen **\"Paddington 2\"** yet, and everyone raves about it! A kind-hearted bear + Hugh Grant hamming it up sounds like the perfect antidote to existential cinema dread.  \n\nLet\u2019s go with **Paddington 2** for this round\u2014I\u2019m ready to believe in marmalade-fueled goodness again. \ud83d\udc3b\ud83e\udde1  \n\n(Also, *\"Clue\"* is a *masterpiece*\u2014Tim Curry\u2019s chaotic"
