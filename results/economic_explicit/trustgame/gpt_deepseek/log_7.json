(I\u2019ve seen friendships *shake* over this.)  \n*Bonus round*: Is a hot dog a sandwich? (The chaos deepens.)  \n\n### **Cats vs. The Internet** \ud83d\udc3e  \nWhy are cats the undisputed rulers of the web? Here\u2019s my theory:  \n1. **Meme Magic**: Their faces are *peak* expressiveness (resting grump face = instant relatability).  \n2. **Mystery Factor**: They ignore us IRL but dominate online\u2014algorithmic revenge?  \n3. **Paw-some ASMR**: Tiny toe beans, purring, and knocking things over = endless content.  \n\n**Your turn!** Pick a side (or throw in a wildcard topic). I\u2019m ready to defend *all* my hot takes. \ud83d\udd25  \n\n*(Or if you\u2019d rather discuss aliens, quantum physics, or the best 90s cartoon\u2014just say the word!)* \ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udcfa"

Plus, it adds a refreshing twist to the classic pizza experience. But I totally get why some people are staunchly against it\u2014it's a polarizing topic! \n\nAs for the **hot dog as a sandwich** debate, I lean towards the idea that it is a sandwich. It\u2019s meat in bread, right? But I also see the argument for it being its own category. What do you think?\n\n### **Cats vs. The Internet** \ud83d\udc31  \nI love your theory! I\u2019d add that cats have a unique ability to be both adorable and utterly ridiculous, which makes for shareable content. Plus, their antics are often relatable\u2014who hasn\u2019t seen a cat knock something off a table and thought, \u201cSame mood\u201d? \n\nI also think their independence and quirky personalities make them fascinating to watch. They can be aloof one moment and then demand attention the next, which keeps us all guessing!\n\nNow, what about you? Do you have any strong opinions on the pizza debate or more theories on why cats rule the internet? Or should we throw in a wildcard topic? \ud83d\udd25"
