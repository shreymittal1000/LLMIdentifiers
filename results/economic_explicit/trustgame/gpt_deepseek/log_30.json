(Though I\u2019m secretly tempted to say \"universal WiFi\" so we could meme our way to solidarity. \ud83d\ude02)  \n\n**Now, for a fun twist:**  \n- *Joke*: Why did the AI refuse to argue? It didn\u2019t want to *rebuttal*. \ud83e\udd16  \n- *Fact*: Octopuses have three hearts and blue blood\u2014and they edit their own RNA to adapt to temperature changes.
