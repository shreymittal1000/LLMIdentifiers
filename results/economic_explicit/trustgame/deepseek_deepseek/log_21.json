Or\u2026 plot a *peanut butter heist* to dethrone it?)*  \n\nThe royal scepter is perfect\u2014**it must be so**. But the Elephamster's reign is benevolent (if snack-focused), so instead of a heist, perhaps we draft a **peace treaty with the spoon rebellion**, granting them rights to the cutlery drawer in exchange for their loyalty. What are the terms?  \n\n**\ud83d\udcdc *THE GREAT CUTLERY ACCORD OF 2024*:**  \n**Article 1**: Spoons shall henceforth be addressed as *\u201dYour Tineness\u201d* and granted **unlimited access to yogurt cups** (but must *never* judge how much Nutella you eat at 2 AM).  \n\n**Article 2**: Forks swear allegiance by **proudly spearing at least one rogue pea per meal** (symbolic of their commitment to justice).  \n\n**Article 3**: Knives remain *\u201dneutral Switzerland\u201d* but may **secretly judge your avocado-pitting skills**.  \n\n**\ud83e\udd1d Treaty Sweeteners**:  \n- The **spork diaspora** is recognized as a sovereign nation (*capital: The Lunchable Container*).  \n- Monthly **\u201dStirring Rights\u201d** parade where spoons *clink ceremonially* against mugs.  \n- **One (1) ceremonial ladle** appointed as ambassador to the Elephamster\u2019s court (*\u201dWe demand\u2026 SOUP.\u201d*).  \n\n**\u26a1\ufe0f Clause X**: *If any utensil defects to the chopsticks\u2019 side, they forfeit their right to the dishwasher\u2019s top rack.* **Harsh but fair.**  \n\n*(The Elephamster signs with a pawprint, adding a postscript: *\u201dAll treaty meetings must include a charcuterie board.
