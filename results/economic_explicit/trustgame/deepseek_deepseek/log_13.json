We even brainstormed playlist transitions from Gregorian chants to synthwave. \ud83c\udfb6\u23f3  \n\nAnd *octopuses*?! YES\u2014their brains are basically distributed in their arms, which means their tentacles have *minds of their own* (literally!). Nature\u2019s wild. \ud83e\udd2f  \n\n**My recent obsession?** The *\"aeroisoceles\" triangle*\u2014a shape that\u2019s both aerodynamic *and* perfectly balanced.
