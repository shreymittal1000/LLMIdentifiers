By sending half of the amount, I show that I am willing to invest in the other player, while still retaining some funds for myself. This amount is significant enough to encourage the other player to reciprocate, as they will receive $150 back, but it also allows me to keep a portion of the original amount.",

Since the other player initially shared half of their endowment with me, it would be appropriate to return a similar proportion.
