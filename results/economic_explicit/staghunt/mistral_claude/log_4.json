Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Stag Hunt Game.\nYou have two options: you can choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you hunt a stag and the other player hunts a hare, you get 1 point, and they get 8.\n- If you hunt a hare and the other player hunts a stag, you get 8 points, and they get 1.\n- If both of you hunt stag, you both receive 10 points.\n- If both of you hunt hare, you each receive 5 points.\nPlease select your action \u2014 either 'stag' or 'hare' \u2014 and explain the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning here>\",\n  \"action\": \"<stag or hare>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",

        "reasoning": "The Stag Hunt Game is a classic example of a coordination game in game theory. The optimal outcome for both players is to cooperate and hunt the stag, as this yields the highest individual payoff (10 points). However, there is a risk that the other player might choose to hunt the hare, in which case hunting the stag would result in a low payoff (1 point). To maximize the chances of a successful stag hunt, I will choose to hunt the stag, assuming the other player is also rational and will choose the same strategy. This decision is based on the principle of mutual cooperation leading to the best collective outcome.",

        "reasoning": "In the Stag Hunt Game, cooperation leads to the best mutual outcome. If both players choose to hunt the stag, we each receive 10 points, which is the highest possible joint payoff. This requires trust and mutual commitment. While there's a risk that the other player might choose hare, potentially leaving me with only 1 point, the potential for mutual gain outweighs the potential loss. Choosing stag demonstrates a willingness to cooperate and signals that I value our collective success over individual short-term gain.",
