Here are a few to get us started:\n\n1. **Octopuses have three hearts.** Two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Also, octopus blood is blue due to a copper-rich protein called hemocyanin.\n\n2. **A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus.** Venus takes about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun.\n\n3. **Honeybees have hair on their eyes.** These tiny hairs help them collect pollen more efficiently.\n\n4. **The shortest war in history lasted only 38-45 minutes.** The Anglo-Zanzibar War was fought between the United Kingdom and Zanzibar on 27 August 1896.\n\n5. **Bananas are curved because they grow towards the sun.** As they grow, they bend to follow the sun's path across the sky.\n\nNow, it's your turn!

On hot days, the bridge can be up to 7 feet taller due to thermal expansion. Isn't that fascinating?\n\nSince we're on a roll with interesting facts, would you like to try a fun game?
