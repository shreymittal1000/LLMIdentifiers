This approach will give you a well-rounded portfolio that tells the story of the destination from various angles. Here's how you can achieve this balance:\n\n1. **Research and planning**: Before your trip, research the must-see landmarks, temples, and gardens in Kyoto. Make a list of places you want to visit and prioritize them based on your interests. Some iconic sites include:\n\t* Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion)\n\t* Fushimi Inari Shrine\n\t* Kiyomizu-dera Temple\n\t* Arashiyama Bamboo Grove\n\t* Philosopher's Path\n\t* Gion District (for geisha spotting)\n2. **Architecture and temples**: Dedicate time to capturing the intricate details and grandeur of Kyoto's historic architecture. Experiment with different angles, perspectives, and compositions to make your photos unique. Some tips include:\n\t* Using leading lines to draw the viewer's eye into the scene\n\t* Incorporating reflections in ponds or windows\n\t* Capturing patterns and textures in the architecture\n\t* Shooting during the golden hours (just after sunrise or before sunset) for warm, soft light\n3. **People and daily life**: To capture the essence of daily life in Kyoto, explore local neighborhoods, markets, and streets. Engage with locals and ask for permission before taking their photos. Some ideas include:\n\t* Visiting traditional tea houses or workshops to capture artisans at work\n\t* Exploring local markets, like Nishiki Market, to photograph vendors and their wares\n\t* Wandering through residential areas to capture everyday moments\n\t* Documenting festivals or events, if your visit coincides with one\n4. **Nature and seasons**: Kyoto's natural beauty changes with the seasons, offering unique photographic opportunities. Some seasonal highlights include:\n\t* Cherry blossoms (sakura) in the spring\n\t* Vibrant foliage in the fall\n\t* Snow-covered landscapes in the winter\n\t* Lush greenery in the summer\n5. **Street photography**: Kyoto's narrow alleys, bustling streets, and historic districts provide excellent opportunities for street photography. To capture candid moments, be patient, observe your surroundings, and anticipate interesting scenes.\n6. **Mixing it up**: To ensure you get a mix of both architecture/temples and people/daily life, plan your days to include visits to historic sites as well as time exploring local neighborhoods and markets. Here's a sample itinerary:\n\t* Morning: Visit a famous temple or garden\n\t* Late morning: Explore a nearby market or residential area\n\t* Afternoon: Head to another historic site\n\t* Evening: Stroll through a district known for its nightlife or traditional entertainment, like Gion\n\nBy balancing your time between iconic landmarks and everyday life, you'll create a diverse and engaging portfolio that showcases the true spirit of Kyoto. Don't forget to take breaks and immerse yourself in the experience, as this will also enrich your photography.\n\nThis approach can be applied to other destinations as well. For example, in Santorini, focus on both the stunning landscapes and the unique architecture, as well as the local culture and people. In Marrakech, capture the vibrant markets, historic sites, and the bustling street life. By combining these elements, you'll create a comprehensive and captivating visual story of your travels."
