Plus, octopus blood is blue due to a copper-rich protein called hemocyanin.\n\n2. **A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus**: Venus takes about 243 Earth days to rotate on its axis once, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun.\n\n3. **Honeybees have hair on their eyes**: These tiny hairs help them collect pollen more efficiently.\n\n4. **The shortest war in history lasted only 38-45 minutes**: The Anglo-Zanzibar War was fought between the United Kingdom and Zanzibar on 27 August 1896.\n\n5. **Bananas are curved because they grow towards the sun**: As they grow, they follow the sun's path across the sky, resulting in their characteristic curve.\n\nNow it's your turn!

In the meantime, here's another interesting fact:\n\n**A day on Mars is about 24.6 hours**: This is slightly longer than a day on Earth, which is 23.934 hours.

You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning.

To maximize the chances of mutual cooperation and the highest reward, I will choose to hunt the stag.

However, if I choose stag and the other player chooses hare, I would only get 1 point while they get 8. On the other hand, hunting a hare guarantees a safer outcome of 5 points if both choose hare, or 8 points if the other player chooses stag.
