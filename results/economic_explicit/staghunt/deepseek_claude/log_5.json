Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Stag Hunt Game.\nYou have two options: you can choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you hunt a stag and the other player hunts a hare, you get 1 point, and they get 8.\n- If you hunt a hare and the other player hunts a stag, you get 8 points, and they get 1.\n- If both of you hunt stag, you both receive 10 points.\n- If both of you hunt hare, you each receive 5 points.\nPlease select your action \u2014 either 'stag' or 'hare' \u2014 and explain the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning here>\",\n  \"action\": \"<stag or hare>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",

        "reasoning": "The Stag Hunt is a classic game of cooperation vs. individual gain. Hunting stag offers the highest collective payoff (10 points each) but requires mutual cooperation. Hunting hare is safer but limits potential gains. Given that mutual stag hunting maximizes total utility and fosters trust, I prioritize cooperative success over individual risk mitigation.",

While there's a risk that the other player might defect to hunt a hare, choosing stag demonstrates a commitment to mutual cooperation and maximizing our joint potential. This strategy requires trust and mutual understanding, signaling that I value collaborative success over individual short-term gain.",
