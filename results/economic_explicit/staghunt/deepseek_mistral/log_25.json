    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Stag Hunt. You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text.

        "reasoning": "The Stag Hunt game represents a coordination problem where mutual cooperation yields the highest collective payoff (10 points each for both hunting stag). While hunting hare is safer (guaranteed 5 points), choosing stag demonstrates trust in the other player's cooperation and maximizes potential gains. Given that mutual stag hunting is the Pareto optimal outcome, I will choose to hunt stag to encourage cooperation and achieve the best possible joint result.",

However, there is a risk that the other player might choose to hunt the hare, which would result in a lower reward for me (1 point). Given the potential for mutual benefit, I will choose to hunt the stag, hoping that the other player will also choose to cooperate.",
