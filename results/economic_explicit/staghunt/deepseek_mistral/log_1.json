You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text.

While hunting a stag promises the highest mutual reward (10 points each), it requires trust that the other agent will also choose to cooperate. Hunting a hare is the safer option, guaranteeing a moderate payoff (5 points) regardless of the other's choice. However, since this is the first interaction with no prior knowledge of the other agent's tendencies, I will opt for cooperation (stag) to signal willingness for mutual benefit and potentially achieve the optimal outcome.",
