Hunting a stag (cooperating) has the highest collective payoff (10 points each) but requires mutual trust, while hunting a hare (defecting) is safer but yields lower rewards. I prioritize mutual benefit and long-term cooperation, so I choose 'stag'. If the other player also cooperates, we maximize our joint outcome.

However, there is a risk that the other player might choose to hunt a hare, resulting in a low reward of 1 point. Hunting a hare is a safer option with a guaranteed 5 points if both players choose it, but the reward is lower than hunting a stag together.
