However, choosing hare is safer as it guarantees at least 5 points regardless of the other's choice. Given the uncertainty of the other agent's decision, I'll prioritize cooperation for mutual benefit, hoping they do the same. The risk of ending up with 1 point (if they defect) is outweighed by the potential for maximum joint gain.",
