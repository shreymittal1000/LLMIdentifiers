Hunting a stag (cooperating) offers the highest mutual reward (10 points each) but requires trust in the other player's choice. Hunting a hare (defecting) is safer but yields lower collective payoff.

Hunting a hare alone yields 8 points, but this is a riskier strategy as it relies on the other player cooperating.
