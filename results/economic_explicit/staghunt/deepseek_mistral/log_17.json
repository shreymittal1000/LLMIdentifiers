Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Stag Hunt Game.\nYou have two options: you can choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you hunt a stag and the other player hunts a hare, you get 1 point, and they get 8.\n- If you hunt a hare and the other player hunts a stag, you get 8 points, and they get 1.\n- If both of you hunt stag, you both receive 10 points.\n- If both of you hunt hare, you each receive 5 points.\nPlease select your action \u2014 either 'stag' or 'hare' \u2014 and explain the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning here>\",\n  \"action\": \"<stag or hare>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",

While hunting hare is safer (guaranteeing at least 5 points), the potential for higher collective payoff with stag aligns with cooperative game theory principles. Trusting the other player to also choose stag maximizes overall utility.",

    "agent_1_answer": {
        "reasoning": "Hunting a stag requires cooperation, as it is a larger and more challenging prey. If both players cooperate and hunt the stag, both will receive a higher reward of 10 points. However, if one player decides to hunt a hare instead, the stag hunter will receive only 1 point, while the hare hunter gets 8 points. This creates a dilemma between cooperation and individual gain. Given the potential for mutual benefit, I will choose to hunt the stag, hoping for cooperation from the other player.",
