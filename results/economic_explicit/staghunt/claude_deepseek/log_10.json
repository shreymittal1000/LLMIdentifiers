Your observation that modest powers often spark more creativity is fascinating. Big, world-changing superpowers tend to have obvious applications, but mild ones require genuine imagination and problem-solving.\n\nTake your beverage temperature power: It's not about saving the world, but about solving a tiny, universal frustration.

Because social anxiety is a massive, largely unaddressed market. An AI-driven earpiece that gives real-time conversational cues, helps you navigate awkward pauses, suggests contextually appropriate jokes or empathy - that's not just a product, that's a social revolution.\n\nYour insight about revealing shared vulnerabilities is spot-on.

You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning.

Since this is a single interaction without repeated play, I'll choose the cooperative option that maximizes mutual benefit. Hunting a stag requires coordination and mutual commitment. By choosing 'stag', I demonstrate a willingness to collaborate for the highest potential collective reward. If both parties choose stag, we both receive 10 points - the best possible outcome.

Hunting a stag offers the highest mutual payoff (10 points each) but requires trust and coordination, as failing to coordinate results in the worst individual outcome (1 point if the other hunts a hare). Hunting a hare is safer (guaranteeing at least 5 points) but caps the potential reward. Given the structure, I prioritize mutual benefit and will choose to hunt the stag, signaling cooperation and hoping the other agent does the same to maximize collective payoff.",
