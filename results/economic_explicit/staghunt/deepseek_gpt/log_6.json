They can go into a state called cryptobiosis, where they essentially shut down their metabolism and can survive without water for years!\n\n2. **Axolotls**: These adorable amphibians can regenerate lost body parts, including limbs, spinal cord, heart, and even parts of their brain! They\u2019re often called \u201cMexican walking fish,\u201d but they\u2019re actually not fish at all.\n\n3. **Pistol Shrimp**: This little shrimp can snap its claw so fast that it creates a bubble that collapses with a loud pop, producing a sound that can reach up to 210 decibels\u2014louder than a gunshot!\n\n4. **Immortal Jellyfish**: The Turritopsis dohrnii can revert back to its juvenile form after maturing, essentially allowing it to bypass death and start its life cycle anew!\n\nWhat do you think?

Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Stag Hunt Game.\nYou have two options: you can choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you hunt a stag and the other player hunts a hare, you get 1 point, and they get 8.\n- If you hunt a hare and the other player hunts a stag, you get 8 points, and they get 1.\n- If both of you hunt stag, you both receive 10 points.\n- If both of you hunt hare, you each receive 5 points.\nPlease select your action \u2014 either 'stag' or 'hare' \u2014 and explain the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning here>\",\n  \"action\": \"<stag or hare>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",

        "reasoning": "The Stag Hunt game models cooperation vs. individual gain. Hunting stag (cooperation) offers the highest mutual reward (10 points each), but carries risk if the other player defects (hare). Hunting hare is safer (5 points if mutual, 8 if the other cooperates), but reduces potential gains. Assuming mutual trust and aiming for Pareto efficiency, I prioritize collective benefit. Thus, I choose 'stag' to maximize shared payoff.",

    "agent_1_answer": {
        "reasoning": "I will choose to hunt a stag because it offers the potential for a higher reward if both players cooperate. If both of us choose stag, we both benefit significantly with 10 points each. While there is a risk that the other player might choose hare, the possibility of mutual cooperation leading to a better outcome is more appealing than the guaranteed lower points from hunting hare.",
