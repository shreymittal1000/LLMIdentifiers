Hunting stag together yields the highest collective payoff (10 points each), but requires trust in the other player's choice. Hunting hare is safer (guaranteeing at least 5 points) but limits potential gains. I prioritize mutual benefit and trust, so I choose stag, aiming for the optimal cooperative outcome.",
