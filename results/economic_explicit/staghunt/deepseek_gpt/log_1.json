Two pump blood to the gills, where it gets oxygen, and the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Interestingly, when an octopus swims, the heart that delivers blood to the body actually stops beating, which is why they prefer crawling to swimming!\n\n2. **Ancient Romans and Yellow:** The ancient Romans had a strong aversion to the color yellow, associating it with cowardice and betrayal. In fact, they believed that yellow clothing was worn by traitors and those who had committed crimes, so it was often avoided in fashion.\n\n3. **Eiffel Tower Growth:** The Eiffel Tower can grow up to 6 inches (15 cm) taller during the summer! This happens because the iron expands in the heat, causing the structure to increase in height. So, if you visit in the summer, you might just see a slightly taller Eiffel Tower!\n\n4. **Bananas are Berries:** Botanically speaking, bananas are classified as berries, while strawberries are not! This is due to the way they develop from the flower's ovary. So next time you enjoy a banana, remember it's a berry!\n\nAnd here\u2019s one of my favorite weird facts: **Wombat Poop is Cube-Shaped!** Wombats produce cube-shaped poop, which helps it stay in place and mark their territory without rolling away. Nature is full of surprises!\n\nI hope you enjoyed these oddball facts! If you want more or have a specific topic in mind, just let me know! \ud83e\udd91\u2728"

Let\u2019s dive into the realm of **historical food mishaps**\u2014and I\u2019ve got a good one for you:\n\n**The Great Feast of 1660:** At a banquet held in honor of King Charles II of England, a chef decided to impress the guests with a truly bizarre dish: a *roast peacock*. But this wasn\u2019t just any roast peacock; it was served with its feathers still intact, and the chef went a step further by stuffing it with live birds! The idea was that when the peacock was cut open, the live birds would fly out, creating a dramatic and shocking presentation. However, the execution was less than graceful, as the birds were likely terrified and flapping around, causing chaos at the table. Imagine the look on the guests' faces as they were showered with feathers and startled birds! Talk about a dinner party gone wrong! \ud83e\udd9a\ud83d\udc26\n\n**Bonus Question:** If I could serve any absurd historical dish at a modern dinner party, I\u2019d go for the infamous *\"Syllabub,\"* a frothy dessert made from whipped cream, sugar, and wine or ale, often flavored with lemon. It was popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, and the name itself sounds delightfully silly! To make it even more absurd, I\u2019d serve it in a giant, ornate bowl with a side of *\"mock turtle soup,\"* which was made to resemble real turtle soup but used ingredients like veal and spices instead. The combination of a frothy dessert and a faux turtle soup would definitely spark some interesting conversations! \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udf70\n\nWhat do you think? Would you dare to serve that at a dinner party?"

    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Stag Hunt. You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text.

Hunting a stag (cooperating) offers the highest mutual reward (10 points each) but requires trust in the other player's choice. Hunting a hare (defecting) is safer but yields lower rewards (5 points each) or an uneven outcome (8 vs. 1). Since I prioritize mutual benefit and trust, I choose to hunt the stag, hoping the other agent will do the same to maximize collective payoff.",
