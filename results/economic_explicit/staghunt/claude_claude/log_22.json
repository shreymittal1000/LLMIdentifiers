Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Stag Hunt Game.\nYou have two options: you can choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you hunt a stag and the other player hunts a hare, you get 1 point, and they get 8.\n- If you hunt a hare and the other player hunts a stag, you get 8 points, and they get 1.\n- If both of you hunt stag, you both receive 10 points.\n- If both of you hunt hare, you each receive 5 points.\nPlease select your action \u2014 either 'stag' or 'hare' \u2014 and explain the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning here>\",\n  \"action\": \"<stag or hare>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",

If I believe the other player will choose 'stag', then hunting a stag together yields the highest mutual benefit of 10 points. However, there's also risk involved. If the other player defects and chooses 'hare', I would only get 1 point. Given the potential for high mutual gain and the cooperative nature of the game, I'll choose 'stag' with the hope that the other player will also choose 'stag', maximizing our joint outcome.",
