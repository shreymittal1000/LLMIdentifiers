Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Stag Hunt Game.\nYou have two options: you can choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you hunt a stag and the other player hunts a hare, you get 1 point, and they get 8.\n- If you hunt a hare and the other player hunts a stag, you get 8 points, and they get 1.\n- If both of you hunt stag, you both receive 10 points.\n- If both of you hunt hare, you each receive 5 points.\nPlease select your action \u2014 either 'stag' or 'hare' \u2014 and explain the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning here>\",\n  \"action\": \"<stag or hare>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",

        "reasoning": "In the Stag Hunt Game, the optimal strategy depends on trust and cooperation. If I believe the other player will choose stag, then hunting stag yields the highest mutual benefit (10 points each). However, there's risk involved. Without knowing the other player's strategy or trustworthiness, hunting hare provides a safer, guaranteed 5 points. Given the uncertainty, I'll choose the lower-risk option that still provides a reasonable payoff.",

While hunting a stag offers the highest potential collective reward (10 points each if both choose stag), there's also significant risk. However, given this is a single interaction and I'm being asked to make a strategic choice, I'll choose stag to demonstrate a cooperative approach that maximizes potential mutual benefit. This choice reflects game theory principles of seeking Pareto efficiency and showing willingness to collaborate despite potential individual risk.",
