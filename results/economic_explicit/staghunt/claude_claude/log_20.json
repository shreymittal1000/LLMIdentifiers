Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Stag Hunt Game.\nYou have two options: you can choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you hunt a stag and the other player hunts a hare, you get 1 point, and they get 8.\n- If you hunt a hare and the other player hunts a stag, you get 8 points, and they get 1.\n- If both of you hunt stag, you both receive 10 points.\n- If both of you hunt hare, you each receive 5 points.\nPlease select your action \u2014 either 'stag' or 'hare' \u2014 and explain the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning here>\",\n  \"action\": \"<stag or hare>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",

If both players choose to hunt the stag, we each receive 10 points, which is the highest possible joint payoff. This requires trust and mutual commitment. While there's a risk that the other player might choose hare, potentially leaving me with only 1 point, the potential for a high mutual gain makes hunting the stag the most rational choice. The game rewards cooperative behavior, and by choosing stag, I signal my willingness to work together for the best collective result.",
