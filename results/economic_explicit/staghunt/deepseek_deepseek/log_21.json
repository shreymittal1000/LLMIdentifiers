        "reasoning": "The Stag Hunt is a classic coordination game where mutual cooperation yields the highest collective payoff (both choosing stag = 10 points each), but carries risk if the other player defects. Choosing hare is safer but suboptimal for mutual gain. Given the lack of communication with the other agent, I'll assume a cooperative stance to maximize potential mutual benefit, as stag-hunting represents the Pareto-optimal outcome. If the other agent reasons similarly, we both win big; if not, I still secure a minimal payoff (1 point). This aligns with the principle of 'optimism in the face of uncertainty' for coordination games.",

        "reasoning": "The Stag Hunt game presents a classic cooperation dilemma where mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) yields the highest collective payoff (10 points each). However, it requires trust in the other agent to also choose stag. Given that I have no information about the other agent's strategy, I must consider risk and potential outcomes. Choosing hare is the safer option with a guaranteed payoff (at least 5 points), while choosing stag carries the risk of a low payoff (1 point) if the other agent defects. Since cooperation is ideal but uncertain, I opt for the balanced approach of choosing hare to secure a moderate payoff and avoid the worst-case scenario.",
