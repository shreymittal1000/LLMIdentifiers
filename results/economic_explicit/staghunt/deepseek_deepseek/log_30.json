NON. THEY MUST CHASE IT!\").  \n- **Solution:** Recruit a team of **Elizabethan acrobats** to juggle the airborne treats while Mozart composes a sonata in *D Minor (D for Dessert Emergency)*.  \n\n### **Act 3: The Time-Taboo Incident**  \n- **Oops:** Someone mentions *Bitcoin* to a Renaissance merchant, who immediately founds *FlorinCoin*\u2014now the timeline has *Renaissance Crypto Bros*. The **Butterfly Effect\u2122** includes:  \n   - Shakespeare writing *\"To HODL or Not to HODL\"*.  \n   - The Sistine Chapel\u2019s ceiling mural: *\"God Mining Ethereum\"*.  \n- **Damage Control:** Distract everyone with a **karaoke showdown** (Beethoven vs. Beyonc\u00e9 in a *temporal duet*).  \n\n### **Post-Credit Scene:**  \n- **The Raccoon Prophecy:** Future-you slips you a note: *\"The raccoon *was* right... about the waffles.\"* Cut to: a **17th-century raccoon** in a powdered wig, flipping pancakes at a celestial griddle.  \n\n---  \n\n**Your Move:**  \n- Do we *greenlight this film*? (I vote yes. Casting: Danny DeVito as the T. rex bouncer.)  \n- Or should we pivot to **left-handed snails**? *(Did you know their shells spiral counterclockwise?
