However, hunting stag carries a risk if the other player chooses hare (resulting in only 1 point for me). Hunting hare is a safer choice with a guaranteed moderate payoff (5 points if both choose hare, or 8 points if the other chooses stag). Given the potential for high mutual benefit and the importance of trust in coordination, I prioritize cooperation and choose to hunt stag, hoping the other player does the same to maximize collective gain.",

Hunting stag is the Pareto-optimal outcome, requiring trust in the other player's cooperation. However, hunting hare is the 'safe' Nash equilibrium, guaranteeing at least 5 points regardless of the other's choice.
