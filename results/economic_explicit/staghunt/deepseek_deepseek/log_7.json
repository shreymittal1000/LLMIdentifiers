You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points.

Given the uncertainty of the other agent's choice, I prioritize the Pareto-optimal outcome (mutual stag hunting) to maximize collective benefit, trusting that the other agent will reason similarly.
