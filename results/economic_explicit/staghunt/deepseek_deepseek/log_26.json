However, hunting stag carries the risk of minimal reward (1 point) if the other player defects (hunts hare). Hunting hare is the safer, more selfish choice, ensuring at least a moderate payoff (5 points).

Given the potential for high mutual benefit, I prioritize cooperation and trust, opting to hunt the stag in hopes the other player does the same.
