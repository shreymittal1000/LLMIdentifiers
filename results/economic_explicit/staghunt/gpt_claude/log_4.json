    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Stag Hunt. You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text.

However, if the other player chooses a hare, I would receive fewer points. On the other hand, hunting a hare guarantees a decent score regardless of the other player's choice. Given the potential for cooperation and the higher reward for mutual stag hunting, I will choose to hunt a stag.",

        "reasoning": "In the Stag Hunt game, cooperation leads to the best collective outcome. If both players choose to hunt a stag, they each receive 10 points, which is the highest mutual gain. While there's a risk that the other player might choose a hare, the potential reward of mutual cooperation outweighs the safer but less rewarding strategy of hunting a hare. Trust and the possibility of mutual benefit suggest that choosing 'stag' is the most rational and potentially rewarding strategy.",
