It's a thought-provoking film that explores themes of identity, humanity, and the future. The visuals are stunning, and the story is engaging and deep.\n\nIf you're not in the mood for science fiction, or if you'd like a different genre, just let me know! I can suggest something else.

You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points.
