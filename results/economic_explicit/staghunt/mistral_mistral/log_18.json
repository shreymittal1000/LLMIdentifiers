Venus takes about 243 Earth days to rotate on its axis once, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun. Isn't that amazing?\n\nNow, it's your turn to share something if you'd like, or we can choose another topic from the list you provided."

Here's an interesting fact for you:\n\nDid you know that a single strand of spider silk is thinner than a human hair but five times stronger than steel of the same diameter? Spider silk is one of the strongest materials known to man, and scientists are studying it for potential applications in medicine, engineering, and other fields.\n\nNow, if you're up for it, how about a riddle? Here it is:\n\nI speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"

Its strength and versatility make it a fascinating subject for research.\n\nNow, let's tackle the riddle you've presented:\n\n\"I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?\"\n\nThe answer is an echo. An echo reflects sound waves, making it seem like it's speaking without a mouth and hearing without ears. It has no physical body but is created by the movement of sound through the air, which can be influenced by the wind.\n\nGreat riddle! If you have another one or if there's something else you'd like to talk about or do, just let me know."

A piano has keys that are used to play music, but they can't open any doors.\n\nRiddles are fun! If you have another one or if there's a different topic you'd like to explore, feel free to share.

You typically need to break an egg before you can use it in cooking or baking.\n\nRiddles are a fun way to keep the mind sharp!
