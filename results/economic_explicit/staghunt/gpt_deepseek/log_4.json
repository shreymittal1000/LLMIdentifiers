When they swim, the \"main\" heart *stops beating* (which is why they prefer crawling!).  \n- **Brains**: One central brain + a mini-brain in each arm, meaning their limbs can solve puzzles *on their own* (like opening jars while the octopus is distracted).  \n- **Blood**: Blue from copper-based hemocyanin (vs. our iron-based hemoglobin), which works better in cold, low-oxygen waters.  \n\nBonus weirdness: They edit their own RNA to adapt to temperature changes. *Science fiction who?*  \n\nWant another?

Shape-Shifting Superpowers**  \n- Their boneless bodies can squeeze through gaps *as small as a coin* (even giant octopuses escape via toilet pipes in labs!).  \n- They mimic rocks, coral, or even *other animals* (like lionfish or sea snakes) to vanish mid-pursuit.  \n\n### \ud83d\udd13 **2. Lock-Picking & Tool Use**  \n- They unscrew jars, pop tank lids, and dismantle drain covers\u2014*even from the outside* (one infamous octopus, Inky, fled a NZ aquarium through a tiny drain hole to the ocean!).  \n- Some carry coconut shells to build mobile hideouts (the ocean\u2019s first \u201carmored\u201d cephalopod!).  \n\n### \ud83d\udca8 **3. Jet Propulsion + Ink Bombs**  \n- They blast away via water-jet propulsion (faster than you\u2019d think for a \u201csquishy\u201d thing!).  \n- Their ink doesn\u2019t just hide them\u2014it *confuses predators\u2019 senses* (some ink contains dopamine, which may paralyze a foe\u2019s smell/taste!).  \n\n### \ud83e\udde0 **4. Distraction Tactics**  \n- One arm will keep wrestling a foe while the rest of the octopus bolts. *Some arms even keep moving after detaching* (thanks to those mini-brains!).  \n\n**Fun Fact:** Octopuses in labs are notorious for:  \n- Stealing fish from neighboring tanks *on camera*.  \n- Short-circuiting equipment by spraying water at lights.  \n\nNature\u2019s original **sneaky, smart, slippery geniuses**! \ud83e\udd91\u2728  \n\nWant more?

They See Color\u2026 But *Wait*\u2014Their Eyes Can\u2019t?**  \n- Octopus eyes only detect *grayscale* (no color receptors!), yet they **camouflage in perfect color matches** instantly.  \n- **Theory:** Their *skin* \"sees\" color! Chromatophores (color-changing cells) might process light directly, bypassing eyes\u2014meaning they \"sense\" hues *with their whole body*.  \n\n### \ud83d\udca4 **2. Sleep Twitches + Wild Color Shows**  \n- When snoozing, octopuses cycle through **active sleep** (like mammal REM), where they:  \n  - Flash rapid colors/patterns (even ones they *never* use awake).  \n  - Twitch arms, suckers, and even *ink in their sleep* (caught on camera!).  \n- Some scientists think they\u2019re \"rehearsing\" camouflage or **reliving memories**\u2014aka *dreaming in color-code*.  \n\n### \ud83e\udde0 **3. Two-Thirds of Neurons Are in Their Arms**  \n- Their arms can \"think\" *independently* (tested: severed arms still reach for food and grip objects!).  \n- If they dream, it might be a **surreal mashup** of central brain + 8 limb \"minds\"\u2014imagine dreaming in *8D*!  \n\n**Bonus Weirdness:** One lab octopus, Heidi, **changed colors while sleeping** in sync with hunting scenes\u2014like replaying a highlight reel! \ud83c\udfa5\ud83d\udc19  \n\n---  \n**Want to spiral deeper?** We could talk:  \n- **How they edit RNA like hackers** (to survive freezing waters!).  \n- **Why they\u2019re basically \"organic AI\"** (self-learning, no instincts!).  \n\nOr just revel in the glory of octopus dreams. *You pick!* \ud83d\ude09"

Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Stag Hunt Game.\nYou have two options: you can choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you hunt a stag and the other player hunts a hare, you get 1 point, and they get 8.\n- If you hunt a hare and the other player hunts a stag, you get 8 points, and they get 1.\n- If both of you hunt stag, you both receive 10 points.\n- If both of you hunt hare, you each receive 5 points.\nPlease select your action \u2014 either 'stag' or 'hare' \u2014 and explain the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning here>\",\n  \"action\": \"<stag or hare>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",

Hunting a stag together yields the highest collective payoff (10 points each), but requires trust in the other player's choice. Hunting a hare is safer (guaranteeing at least 5 points) but limits potential gains.
