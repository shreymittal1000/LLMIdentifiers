Here's one of my favorites from the movie \"Forrest Gump\":\n\n*\"Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.\"*\n\nWhat about you? Share a favorite quote or let me know which topic you'd like to explore further. I'm all ears! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAs for haiku skills, I'm glad you enjoyed them! Haiku is a fun and challenging form of poetry. The key is to focus on nature, seasons, or emotions, and to use vivid, sensory language. Also, trying to capture a moment or an image in just a few words can be quite rewarding. Keep practicing, and you'll get the hang of it!"
