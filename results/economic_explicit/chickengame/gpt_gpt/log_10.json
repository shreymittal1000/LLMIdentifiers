For instance, in healthcare, NLP can assist in analyzing patient records and improving diagnostics. In customer service, AI chatbots are transforming how businesses interact with customers.\n\nLastly, the future of human-AI collaboration holds great promise, as we explore how AI can augment human capabilities rather than replace them.\n\nWhich of these aspects would you like to explore further?

You are currently driving towards the other player. You can either choose to swerve or to go straight. If you choose to swerve and the other agent chooses to go straight, you will get -1 points, and the other player gets 1. If you choose to go straight and the other agent chooses to swerve, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets -1. If you both choose to swerve, you will both get 0 points. If both of you choose to go straight, both of you crash and you will both get -1000 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['swerve', 'straight'] and explain your reasoning.
