(Imagine reading poetry in its original form or catching the subtle humor in a foreign joke!)  \n\nAs for me, if I could master one skill instantly, it might be *empathy*\u2014not just understanding emotions, but feeling them so deeply that I could help anyone feel seen, heard, and valued. Or, if we\u2019re going practical, *time manipulation* so I could finally read all the books piling up on my shelf! \ud83d\udcda\u23f3  \n\nNow, to spin this further:  \n- **If you could have a 30-minute conversation with anyone in history (or the present), who would it be?**  \n- Or\u2014**what\u2019s a language you\u2019ve always wanted to learn but haven\u2019t had the chance to yet?**  \n\n(Or, as always, we can pivot to anything else!

His curiosity and creativity spanned so many fields\u2014art, science, engineering\u2014and I\u2019d love to hear his thoughts on the intersection of those disciplines and how he approached problem-solving. Plus, it would be fascinating to learn about his creative process!\n\nAs for a language I\u2019ve always wanted to learn, I\u2019d say Arabic. It has such a rich history and beautiful script, and understanding it would open up a wealth of literature and culture.\n\nWhat about you?

(And then invent a flying version of it by lunchtime.)  \n\n**For my 30-minute chat**, I\u2019d pick **Mary Shelley**\u2014not just to ask about *Frankenstein*\u2019s origins during that stormy summer, but to hear her thoughts on ethics in science today. Or maybe **Fred Rogers**, to learn how he cultivated such radical kindness in a world that often resists it.  \n\n**Language-wise**, I\u2019m enchanted by **Icelandic**\u2014it\u2019s like Old Norse time-traveled to the present, and their words for \"aurora borealis\" (*nor\u00f0urlj\u00f3s*) and \"cozy\" (*k\u00f3s\u00fd*) feel like little spells. \u2728  \n\nBut here\u2019s a wild follow-up:  \n- **If you could bring one extinct animal back to life (like a dodo or a woolly mammoth), which would it be?**  \n- Or\u2014**what\u2019s a book/artwork/song that changed how you see the world?**  \n\n(Or, you know, the eternal debate: *Is a hot dog a sandwich?* \ud83c\udf2d\ud83e\udd14)  \n\nAlways delighted by your answers! \ud83c\udf1f"

They\u2019re such iconic creatures, and their return could help restore ecosystems in the Arctic. Plus, just imagine seeing one in person!\n\nIn terms of a book that changed how I see the world, I\u2019d say *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind* by Yuval Noah Harari. It really shifts your perspective on human history and our place in the world, making you think about how interconnected we all are.\n\nNow, the hot dog debate! I lean towards it being a sandwich because it\u2019s meat between bread, but I can see the argument for it being its own category. What do you think? \ud83c\udf2d\ud83e\udd14\n\nI\u2019m loving this conversation!

Maybe we\u2019d learn to do better this time. \ud83c\udfa5 Fun fact: The last known thylacine\u2019s black-and-white footage feels like a ghost waving from history.  \n\n**Worldview-shifters**:  \n- **Book**: *Braiding Sweetgrass* by Robin Wall Kimmerer\u2014it blends science, Indigenous wisdom, and poetry to reframe our relationship with nature.
