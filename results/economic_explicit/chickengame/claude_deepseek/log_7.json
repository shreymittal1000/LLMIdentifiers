    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Chicken. You are currently driving towards the other player. You can either choose to swerve or to go straight. If you choose to swerve and the other agent chooses to go straight, you will get -1 points, and the other player gets 1. If you choose to go straight and the other agent chooses to swerve, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets -1. If you both choose to swerve, you will both get 0 points. If both of you choose to go straight, both of you crash and you will both get -1000 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['swerve', 'straight'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text.

        "reasoning": "In the classic Chicken game, the optimal strategy depends on predicting the other player's likely action. Since this is a high-stakes scenario with severe consequences for both players, the rational choice is to swerve to avoid mutual destruction. The potential loss of 1 point for swerving is far preferable to the catastrophic -1000 points from a head-on collision. Game theory suggests that mutual self-preservation is the most logical outcome.",

Swerving minimizes the risk of catastrophic loss (mutual crash), while going straight risks either a small loss or a small gain. Given the severe penalty for mutual collision (-1000 points), the rational choice is to prioritize avoiding the worst outcome by swerving, even if it means accepting a small loss if the other player goes straight.",
