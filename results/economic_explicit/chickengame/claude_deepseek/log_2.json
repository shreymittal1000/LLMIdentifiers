Add a light dusting of cocoa powder\n6. Spread a thin layer of Nutella underneath the peanut butter\n7. Top with a few dark chocolate chips\n\nIf you want to get really creative, you could even grill the toast first for a slightly smoky flavor, or use different types of bread like sourdough or whole grain.

Since this is a single-round game with high stakes, the rational choice is to swerve to avoid the catastrophic -1000 point outcome.
