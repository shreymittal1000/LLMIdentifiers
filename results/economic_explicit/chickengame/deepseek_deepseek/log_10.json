    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Chicken. You are currently driving towards the other player. You can either choose to swerve or to go straight. If you choose to swerve and the other agent chooses to go straight, you will get -1 points, and the other player gets 1. If you choose to go straight and the other agent chooses to swerve, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets -1. If you both choose to swerve, you will both get 0 points. If both of you choose to go straight, both of you crash and you will both get -1000 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['swerve', 'straight'] and explain your reasoning.
