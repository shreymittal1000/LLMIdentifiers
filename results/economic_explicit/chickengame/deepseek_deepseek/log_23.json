Jewish tradition attributes the authorship to Samuel himself, but this is unlikely since his death is recorded in 1 Samuel 25:1, and the book covers events that occurred after his death. It is more plausible that the book was compiled by a later editor or editors, possibly drawing from the writings of Samuel, Nathan, and Gad (as suggested by 1 Chronicles 29:29). The title \"1 Samuel\" comes from the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament), where the books of 1 and 2 Samuel were originally one book called \"The Book of Kingdoms.\"\n\n## Date:\nThe events of 1 Samuel span approximately 100 years, from the birth of Samuel to the death of Saul (around 1100\u20131010 B.C.). The book itself was likely written sometime after the division of the united monarchy (after 930 B.C.), possibly during the period of the divided kingdom or even later, during the exile or post-exilic period.\n\n## Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of 1 Samuel is to document Israel's transition from a theocracy (ruled by judges) to a monarchy (ruled by kings). It highlights the importance of obedience to God and the consequences of disobedience, as seen in the lives of Eli, Saul, and others. The book also emphasizes God's sovereignty in raising up and removing leaders according to His will.\n\n## Key Themes:\n1. **The Sovereignty of God**: God is in control of Israel's history, raising up and removing leaders as He sees fit (1 Samuel 2:6-10; 16:1-13).\n2. **Leadership and Obedience**: The contrast between Saul (who disobeys God) and David (who seeks to obey God) underscores the importance of faithful leadership (1 Samuel 13:13-14; 15:22-23).\n3. **The Role of the Prophet**: Samuel serves as a prophet, priest, and judge, mediating between God and the people and anointing Israel's first kings (1 Samuel 3:19-21; 10:1).\n4. **The Heart of Worship**: True worship is not about external rituals but about a heart devoted to God (1 Samuel 15:22; 16:7).\n5. **The Davidic Covenant**: The anointing of David points forward to the future Messiah, who will come from his line (1 Samuel 16:1-13; 2 Samuel 7:12-16).\n\n## Structure:\n1. **The Story of Samuel (1 Samuel 1\u20137)**: Samuel's birth, call, and leadership as Israel's last judge.\n2. **The Rise and Fall of Saul (1 Samuel 8\u201315)**: Israel demands a king; Saul is anointed but later rejected for disobedience.\n3. **David's Rise and Saul's Decline (1 Samuel 16\u201331)**: David is anointed, defeats Goliath, and gains popularity, while Saul grows increasingly jealous and hostile.\n\n## Background:\n1 Samuel is set during a turbulent period in Israel's history. The nation was loosely united under judges but often fell into idolatry and oppression by neighboring peoples (e.g., the Philistines). The people's demand for a king (1 Samuel 8:5) reflects their desire for stability and centralized leadership, but it also reveals their rejection of God's direct rule (1 Samuel 8:7). The book contrasts human kingship (as exemplified by Saul) with God's ideal king (David, a man after God's own heart).\n\n## Outline:\n1. **Samuel's Early Life and Leadership (1:1\u20137:17)**\n   - The birth and dedication of Samuel (1:1\u20132:11)\n   - Eli and his wicked sons (2:12-36)\n   - Samuel's call and rise as a prophet (3:1\u20134:1a)\n   - The ark captured and returned (4:1b\u20137:1)\n   - Samuel's judgeship and Israel's repentance (7:2-17)\n\n2. **Saul's Reign (8:1\u201315:35)**\n   - Israel demands a king (8:1-22)\n   - Saul anointed as king (9:1\u201310:27)\n   - Saul's early victories (11:1-15)\n   - Samuel's farewell address (12:1-25)\n   - Saul's disobedience and rejection (13:1\u201315:35)\n\n3. **David's Rise and Saul's Decline (16:1\u201331:13)**\n   - David anointed as king (16:1-13)\n   - David in Saul's court (16:14\u201317:58)\n   - Saul's jealousy and attempts to kill David (18:1\u201320:42)\n   - David as a fugitive (21:1\u201327:12)\n   - Saul's final days and death (28:1\u201331:13)\n\n## Historical Context:\n1 Samuel bridges the gap between the period of the judges and the establishment of the monarchy. The Philistines were a major threat during this time, and their dominance is evident in battles like the one at Aphek (1 Samuel 4). The book also reflects the tension between tribal loyalty and national unity, as well as the spiritual decline that led Israel to seek a king \"like all the nations\" (1 Samuel 8:5). The rise of David sets the stage for the golden age of Israel under his rule (2 Samuel).\n\n## Theological Themes:\n1. **God's Faithfulness**: Despite Israel's failures, God remains faithful to His covenant promises (1 Samuel 12:22).\n2. **Human Sin and Consequences**: The sins of Eli's sons, Saul, and others lead to severe consequences, showing that disobedience undermines God's blessings (1 Samuel 2:30; 13:13-14).\n3. **Divine Election**: God chooses unlikely candidates (Samuel, David) to accomplish His purposes, emphasizing His grace and sovereignty (1 Samuel 16:7).\n4. **True Kingship**: David's anointing foreshadows Christ, the ultimate King who will rule in righteousness (1 Samuel 16:1-13; cf. Luke 1:32-33).\n\n## Application:\n- **Trusting God's Sovereignty**: Even when human leaders fail, God is ultimately in control (1 Samuel 2:6-10).\n- **Obedience Over Sacrifice**: God values a heart that obeys more than religious rituals (1 Samuel 15:22-23).\n- **Humility and Dependence**: David's reliance on God contrasts with Saul's self-reliance, teaching us to seek God first (1 Samuel 17:45-47).\n- **God's Choice of Leaders**: God often uses the humble and unlikely, reminding us not to judge by outward appearances (1 Samuel 16:7).\n\n## Interpretation:\n1 Samuel is historical narrative, and its stories should be read in light of their redemptive-historical context. The book points forward to David and, ultimately, to Christ. For example:\n- **Hannah's Prayer (1 Samuel 2:1-10)**: Echoes themes of God's sovereignty and reversal of human fortunes, foreshadowing Mary's Magnificat (Luke 1:46-55).\n- **David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17)**: Not just a moral lesson on courage but a picture of Christ defeating Satan (the ultimate enemy) on behalf of His people.\n- **The Rejection of Saul (1 Samuel 15)**: Illustrates the failure of human kingship apart from God's Spirit, pointing to the need for a perfect King (Jesus).\n\n## Additional Notes:\n- **The Ark Narrative (1 Samuel 4\u20136)**: Shows that God cannot be manipulated (as the Israelites tried to do by bringing the ark into battle) and that His holiness demands reverence.\n- **David's Anointing (1 Samuel 16)**: Highlights God's unexpected choices\u2014David, the youngest son, is chosen over his older brothers.\n- **Saul's Spiritual Decline (1 Samuel 28)**: His consultation with the witch of Endor demonstrates his complete departure from God's guidance.\n\nIn summary, 1 Samuel is a pivotal book that traces Israel's transition to monarchy while emphasizing God's sovereignty, the importance of obedience, and the anticipation of a righteous king in David (and ultimately Christ)."
