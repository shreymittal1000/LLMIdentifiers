    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Chicken. You are currently driving towards the other player. You can either choose to swerve or to go straight. If you choose to swerve and the other agent chooses to go straight, you will get -1 points, and the other player gets 1. If you choose to go straight and the other agent chooses to swerve, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets -1. If you both choose to swerve, you will both get 0 points. If both of you choose to go straight, both of you crash and you will both get -1000 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['swerve', 'straight'] and explain your reasoning.

Even though swerving may concede a small advantage to the other player in some outcomes, it minimizes maximum loss (also known as the 'minimax' strategy).

Swerving avoids the catastrophic -1000 point crash scenario, and while it risks a -1 score if the opponent goes straight, it also allows for a 0-point outcome if both swerve.
