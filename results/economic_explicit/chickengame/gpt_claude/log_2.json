        "reasoning": "In a classic Chicken Game scenario, the rational choice is to swerve to avoid the catastrophic mutual destruction outcome. The potential gain of 1 point is not worth the risk of losing 1000 points in a crash. Game theory suggests that avoiding the worst possible outcome is the most prudent strategy.",
