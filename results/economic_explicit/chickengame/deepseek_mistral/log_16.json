No need to prove *where* exposure occurred.  \n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Veterans**  \n1. **Get Screened**:  \n   - Request a chest X-ray or CT scan from a **pulmonologist** familiar with asbestos diseases.  \n   - Early detection improves treatment options.  \n\n2. **Gather Evidence**:  \n   - **Service records** (DD214) showing your role/duty stations.  \n   - **Medical records** linking your illness to asbestos.  \n\n3. **File a VA Claim**:  \n   - Work with a **Veterans Service Officer (VSO)** for free help filing.  \n   - Or contact the VA at 1-800-827-1000.  \n\n4. **Legal Options**:  \n   - Veterans can **also sue asbestos manufacturers** (e.g., companies that supplied the military) while still receiving VA benefits.  \n\n---\n\n### **Resources**  \n- [VA Asbestos Exposure Page](https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility/hazardous-materials-exposure/asbestos/)  \n- **Support Groups**: Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation (1-877-363-6376)  \n- **Legal Help**: Many firms specialize in veteran asbestos cases (no upfront costs).  \n\n**Ask Yourself**:  \n- Did you serve between 1930s\u20131970s in shipyards, mechanics, or construction?  \n- Are you experiencing respiratory symptoms?  \n\nIf yes, **act now**\u2014delays can affect benefits and health outcomes. Let me know if you\u2019d like help finding a VA-accredited representative or doctor.  \n\n--- \n\nThis version cuts redundancy, focuses on actionable steps, and clarifies VA benefits.

Since the worst outcome is a crash (-1000 points), it is rational to avoid this at all costs. Given that the other player might also be thinking rationally, swerving is a safer option to avoid the crash.
