If you're up for it, I can share an interesting fact or a light joke to get us started. Here's one:\n\nDid you know that a day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus? It takes Venus about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun.\n\nOr, if you prefer a joke:\n\nWhat do you call fake spaghetti?\nAn impasta!\n\nWhat would you like to talk about or do next?"

Here are a few suggestions:\n\n* I can tell you a riddle to solve.\n* We can discuss a topic you're interested in, like a hobby, a book, or a movie.\n* I can share a fun trivia question.\n* We can play a simple text-based game, like 20 questions or word association.\n\nWhat would you like to do next?"

If you'd prefer a different game or activity, just let me know!\n\nIf you're ready to play 20 questions, please think of something\u2014it could be an object, an animal, a place, or anything else\u2014and let me know when you're ready for my first question."
