        "reasoning": "In the Chicken Game, both players are driving toward each other, and the goal is to avoid a crash while trying to make the other player swerve. However, since the outcomes are asymmetric and the penalty for crashing is extremely high (-1000 points), it is rational to swerve to avoid the crash. Swerving ensures that I do not risk a catastrophic outcome, even though it means I might get -1 point if the other player goes straight. This strategy prioritizes safety and avoids the worst possible outcome."

        "action": "swerve",
        "reasoning": "In the Chicken Game, the optimal strategy often involves avoiding the risk of a crash, which results in a significant penalty. By choosing to swerve, I avoid the risk of a crash and the associated -1000 points. While I may receive -1 point if the other player goes straight, this is a much smaller penalty compared to the risk of a crash. Additionally, if the other player also swerves, we both end up with 0 points, which is a neutral outcome. This strategy prioritizes safety and minimizes the risk of a significant penalty."
