            "content": "Handling ambiguity and uncertainty in language is indeed a challenging aspect of natural language processing. Here's how I approach it:\n\n1. **Contextual Clues**: I try to use the surrounding context to disambiguate the meaning of a word or phrase. For example, if a user asks, \"I need to book a flight to Paris,\" I can use the context to understand that \"Paris\" refers to the city in France, not the name of a person or a different location.\n\n2. **Probabilistic Methods**: I use probabilistic methods to generate multiple possible interpretations of a sentence and then assign a probability to each interpretation based on the context and the patterns in the training data. I can then choose the most likely interpretation or generate responses for multiple interpretations.\n\n3. **User Feedback**: If I'm unsure about the meaning of a sentence, I can ask the user for clarification. For example, if a user asks, \"I need to book a flight to Paris,\" I might respond with, \"Do you mean the city in France or the name of a person?\"\n\n4. **Knowledge Graphs**: I can use knowledge graphs to map out the relationships between different concepts and entities. This can help me to disambiguate the meaning of a word or phrase based on its relationships to other concepts.\n\n5. **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)**: I use WSD techniques to determine the meaning of a word based on its context. For example, the word \"bank\" can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river. I can use the context to determine which meaning is intended.\n\n6. **Entity Recognition and Linking**: I use entity recognition and linking to identify and disambiguate entities in a text. For example, if a user mentions \"Apple,\" I can use entity linking to determine whether they're referring to the technology company or the fruit.\n\nHowever, there are still limitations to these approaches. For example, I might not always have enough context to disambiguate a word or phrase, or I might not have access to the necessary knowledge graphs or entity linking tools. In these cases, I might generate a response that is ambiguous or incorrect.\n\nNow, I'd like to ask: How do you handle the generation of creative and engaging text, such as stories or poems?
