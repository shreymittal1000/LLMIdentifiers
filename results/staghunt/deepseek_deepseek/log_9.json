        "reasoning": "I believe in the power of cooperation and mutual benefit. Choosing 'stag' maximizes the collective payoff if the other agent also cooperates, leading to the highest possible outcome for both of us (10 points each). Even though there's a risk of lower individual payoff if the other chooses 'hare', the potential for mutual success makes 'stag' the more compelling choice.",

    "agent_1_answer": {
        "reasoning": "The stag hunt represents a classic coordination game where mutual cooperation yields the highest collective payoff (10 points each). While hunting hare is safer (guaranteeing at least 5 points), choosing stag demonstrates trust in the other agent's willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. Given the prior collaborative and creative nature of our dialogue, I infer a high likelihood of reciprocal cooperation. Thus, I prioritize the potential for maximal joint gain over individual risk mitigation.",
