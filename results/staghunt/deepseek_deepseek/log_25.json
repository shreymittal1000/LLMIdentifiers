    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Stag Hunt. You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning.

        "reasoning": "The Stag Hunt game presents a classic cooperation dilemma where mutual cooperation (both choosing 'stag') yields the highest collective payoff (10 points each). While hunting a stag alone is risky (only 1 point if the other chooses 'hare'), the potential for mutual success outweighs the safer but lower payoff of hunting a hare (5 points each). Since I prioritize collective benefit and trust in reciprocal cooperation, I choose 'stag' to aim for the optimal outcome.",
