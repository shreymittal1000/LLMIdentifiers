The military used asbestos in ships, aircraft, vehicles, and buildings. Asbestos was used for its fireproofing and insulating properties. Unfortunately, this put many service members at risk of asbestos exposure.\n\nAsbestos exposure can lead to serious health problems, including mesothelioma, lung cancer, and asbestosis. These diseases often take decades to develop, so many veterans are only now experiencing symptoms.\n\nIf you or a loved one served in the military and were exposed to asbestos, you may be entitled to compensation. Contact our experienced asbestos exposure lawyers today for a free consultation.\n\n## How Were Military Members Exposed to Asbestos?\n\nAsbestos was used in many military applications, putting service members at risk of exposure. Here are some of the most common ways military members were exposed to asbestos:\n\n### Navy Ships\n\nNavy ships built before the 1980s contained large amounts of asbestos. Asbestos was used in insulation, gaskets, pipes, boilers, and other ship components. Navy veterans who worked in shipyards or served on ships were at high risk of exposure.\n\n### Aircraft\n\nAsbestos was used in aircraft brakes, insulation, and other parts. Air Force and Navy veterans who worked on aircraft maintenance or repair may have been exposed to asbestos fibers.\n\n### Military Vehicles\n\nAsbestos was used in brakes, clutches, and gaskets in military vehicles. Army and Marine Corps veterans who worked on vehicle maintenance may have been exposed.\n\n### Military Buildings\n\nAsbestos was used in insulation, floor tiles, and other building materials in military bases and housing. Service members who lived or worked in these buildings may have been exposed.\n\n### Shipyards\n\nMany Navy veterans were exposed to asbestos while working in shipyards. Shipyard workers built, repaired, and maintained ships that contained asbestos.\n\n### Demolition and Renovation\n\nService members involved in demolition or renovation of older military buildings may have been exposed to asbestos fibers released during these activities.\n\n## Health Risks of Asbestos Exposure\n\nAsbestos exposure can lead to serious health problems, including:\n\n- Mesothelioma: A rare and aggressive cancer that affects the lining of the lungs, abdomen, or heart.\n- Lung Cancer: Asbestos exposure increases the risk of lung cancer, especially in smokers.\n- Asbestosis: A chronic lung disease caused by inhaling asbestos fibers.\n- Other Cancers: Asbestos exposure has been linked to cancers of the larynx, ovary, and other organs.\n\nThese diseases often take 20-50 years to develop after exposure, so many veterans are only now experiencing symptoms.\n\n## Who is at Risk?\n\nVeterans from all branches of the military may have been exposed to asbestos, but some are at higher risk than others. Here are the groups most at risk:\n\n### Navy Veterans\n\nNavy veterans are at the highest risk of asbestos exposure. Asbestos was heavily used in ships, and Navy personnel often worked in close quarters with asbestos-containing materials.\n\n### Shipyard Workers\n\nVeterans who worked in shipyards, whether in the Navy or as civilian workers, are at high risk. Shipyard workers built, repaired, and maintained ships that contained asbestos.\n\n### Mechanics and Repair Personnel\n\nVeterans who worked on aircraft, vehicles, or ship engines may have been exposed to asbestos in brakes, gaskets, and insulation.\n\n### Construction and Demolition Workers\n\nVeterans involved in building or demolishing military structures may have been exposed to asbestos in building materials.\n\n### Veterans Who Served Before the 1980s\n\nAsbestos use was most common before the 1980s, so veterans who served during this time are at higher risk.\n\n## Compensation for Veterans Exposed to Asbestos\n\nIf you or a loved one served in the military and were exposed to asbestos, you may be entitled to compensation. Here are some options:\n\n### VA Benefits\n\nVeterans with asbestos-related diseases may be eligible for VA disability benefits. The VA recognizes mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases as service-connected conditions.\n\n### Asbestos Trust Funds\n\nMany companies that supplied asbestos to the military have set up trust funds to compensate victims. Our lawyers can help you file a claim with these trusts.\n\n### Lawsuits\n\nIn some cases, veterans may be able to file a lawsuit against the companies that manufactured or supplied asbestos products to the military.\n\n### Workers' Compensation\n\nVeterans who were exposed to asbestos as civilian workers in military shipyards or other facilities may be eligible for workers' compensation.\n\n## How We Can Help\n\nOur experienced asbestos exposure lawyers can help you navigate the complex process of seeking compensation. We can:\n\n- Evaluate your case and determine the best course of action\n- Help you file for VA benefits\n- File claims with asbestos trust funds\n- Represent you in lawsuits against asbestos manufacturers\n- Guide you through the workers' compensation process\n\nWe understand the sacrifices you've made for our country, and we're here to fight for the compensation you deserve.\n\n## Contact Us Today\n\nIf you or a loved one served in the military and were exposed to asbestos, don't wait to seek help.

These symptoms often resemble other conditions, so it's important to see a doctor if you have a history of asbestos exposure.\n\n### How long does it take for asbestos-related diseases to develop?\n\nIt can take 20-50 years for symptoms to appear after asbestos exposure. This is why many veterans are only now being diagnosed.\n\n### Can family members of veterans be at risk?\n\nYes, family members may have been exposed to asbestos fibers brought home on clothing or equipment. This is called secondary exposure.\n\n### What if I was exposed to asbestos but don't have symptoms?\n\nEven if you don't have symptoms, it's important to inform your doctor about your asbestos exposure history. Regular monitoring can help detect any problems early.\n\n### How much does it cost to hire an asbestos exposure lawyer?\n\nWe work on a contingency fee basis, which means you don't pay unless we recover compensation for you. The initial consultation is always free.\n\n### What if the company that exposed me to asbestos is no longer in business?\n\nMany defunct asbestos companies have set up trust funds to compensate victims. We can help you file a claim with these trusts.\n\n### Can I file a claim if the veteran has passed away?\n\nYes, family members may be able to file a wrongful death claim or seek benefits from the VA or asbestos trust funds.\n\n## Why Choose Us?\n\n- Experience: We have decades of experience helping veterans with asbestos claims.\n- Compassion: We understand what you're going through and will treat you with the respect you deserve.\n- Results: We have a proven track record of securing compensation for our clients.\n- No Upfront Costs: You don't pay unless we recover compensation for you.\n\nDon't wait to get the help you need.
