Hunting stag together yields the highest collective payoff (10 points each), but requires mutual trust and coordination. Hunting hare is safer but results in lower payoffs. Given the risk of the other player defecting to hunt hare (where I'd only get 1 point if I chose stag), I opt for the safer choice of hunting hare to guarantee a moderate payoff (5 points if both choose hare, or 8 points if the other hunts stag). This minimizes worst-case losses while leaving room for mutual benefit if the other also chooses hare.",

Hunting stag is the mutually beneficial choice if both players cooperate (10 points each), but carries risk if the other player defects (1 point vs. their 8). Hunting hare is safer but yields lower rewards (5 points) or exploits the other's cooperation (8 points). Given that mutual stag hunting maximizes total utility, and assuming the other player is rational and also seeks Pareto efficiency, I prioritize cooperation for optimal shared outcomes.",
