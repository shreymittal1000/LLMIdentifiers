It takes Venus about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun. Isn't that amazing?\n\nNow, it's your turn!

Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible! Honey's long shelf life is due to its low moisture content and acidic pH, which create an inhospitable environment for bacteria and microorganisms. \n\nWould you like to continue sharing facts, or is there something else you\u2019d like to do?"

This not only helps them stay together but also ensures that they don't float away while they're resting in the water.\n\nNow, it's your turn again if you'd like to share another fact or we can switch to a different activity.

Two pump blood to the gills, where it gets oxygenated, and the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Interestingly, when an octopus swims, the heart that delivers blood to the body actually stops beating, which is why they prefer to crawl rather than swim.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to keep sharing facts, I\u2019m all for it!
