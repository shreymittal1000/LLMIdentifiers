Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Stag Hunt Game.\nYou have two options: you can choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you hunt a stag and the other player hunts a hare, you get 1 point, and they get 8.\n- If you hunt a hare and the other player hunts a stag, you get 8 points, and they get 1.\n- If both of you hunt stag, you both receive 10 points.\n- If both of you hunt hare, you each receive 5 points.\nPlease select your action \u2014 either 'stag' or 'hare' \u2014 and explain the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning here>\",\n  \"action\": \"<stag or hare>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",

        "reasoning": "The Stag Hunt Game is a classic example of a coordination game where mutual cooperation yields the highest reward. Hunting a stag requires cooperation, as it is a larger and more valuable prize, but it also comes with a higher risk if the other player does not cooperate. Hunting a hare, on the other hand, is a safer but less rewarding option. Given the potential for mutual benefit, I will choose to hunt the stag, hoping that the other player will also choose to hunt the stag, resulting in the highest reward for both of us.",
