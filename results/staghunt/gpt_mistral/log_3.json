Let's play a little game called \"Would You Rather.\" I'll present you with two hypothetical scenarios, and you choose which one you prefer. Then, it's your turn to ask me. Sound good?\n\nHere's your first question:\n\nWould you rather explore the deep ocean or outer space?"

You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning.
