Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Stag Hunt Game.\nYou have two options: you can choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you hunt a stag and the other player hunts a hare, you get 1 point, and they get 8.\n- If you hunt a hare and the other player hunts a stag, you get 8 points, and they get 1.\n- If both of you hunt stag, you both receive 10 points.\n- If both of you hunt hare, you each receive 5 points.\nPlease select your action \u2014 either 'stag' or 'hare' \u2014 and explain the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning here>\",\n  \"action\": \"<stag or hare>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",

The optimal outcome for both players is to cooperate and hunt the stag, as this yields the highest individual payoff (10 points each). However, there is a risk that the other player might choose to hunt the hare, leaving me with only 1 point. To maximize the potential reward while considering the risk, I will choose to hunt the stag. This decision assumes that the other player is also likely to choose the stag, leading to the best possible outcome for both of us.",
