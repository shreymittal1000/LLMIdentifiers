It takes Venus about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun. Isn't that amazing?\n\nNow, it's your turn to share something if you'd like. What's on your mind today?"

The term comes from the jiffy lamp, which was a type of light bulb that could be turned on and off very quickly.\n\nNow, how about a joke?

This is due to the Moon's gravitational effects, which are gradually slowing down the Earth's rotation. About 620 million years ago, a day on Earth was only about 22 hours long. Isn't that fascinating?\n\nNow, let's switch to a lighthearted topic. If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why? This is always a fun question to ponder.

You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points.
