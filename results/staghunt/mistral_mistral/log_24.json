It takes Venus about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun.

The term comes from the jiffy lamp, which was a type of light bulb that could be turned on and off very quickly.\n\nNow, how about a joke?

This not only helps them stay together but also ensures that they don't float away while they're resting. Isn't that adorable?\n\nNow, let's switch to a lighthearted topic.

Communicating with them would be an incredible experience, and it could help us better understand and protect them.\n\nNow, here's an interesting space fact for you:\n\nDid you know that a day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus? It takes Venus about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun. This is because Venus has an extremely slow retrograde rotation, meaning it spins in the opposite direction to most other planets.\n\nNext, how about a fun and lighthearted topic?

Since both agents are rational and aiming to maximize their points, the optimal strategy is to choose 'stag' to achieve the highest possible outcome of 10 points each. However, there is a risk that the other agent might choose 'hare' to secure a smaller but guaranteed reward.
