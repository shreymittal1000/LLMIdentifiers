Here's another interesting fact about space for you:\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nFact: A teaspoonful of a neutron star would weigh billions of tons. Neutron stars are incredibly dense. They are formed from the collapsed cores of massive stars and pack more mass than the Sun into a sphere the size of a city. The gravitational pull on a neutron star is so strong that it compresses everything into a state where electrons and protons are forced together, creating a substance composed almost entirely of neutrons."

Here's another fascinating space fact for you:\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nFact: The International Space Station (ISS) is the most expensive single object ever built. The ISS has been a continuous human presence in space since November 2, 2000. It cost over $150 billion to build and maintain, involving the collaboration of 16 nations. The ISS orbits Earth at an average altitude of approximately 250 miles (400 kilometers) and travels at about 17,500 miles per hour (28,163 kilometers per hour), completing one orbit every 92 minutes.\n\nIf you're interested, I can share more facts about space or we can switch to a different topic.

If you're up for another space fact, here's one:\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nFact: There is a planet where it rains diamonds. On the planet Neptune, the extreme pressure and temperature conditions cause carbon to crystallize into diamonds, which then fall as precipitation. This phenomenon is believed to occur in the deep atmosphere of Neptune and possibly on Uranus as well.\n\nIf you'd like to switch topics, we can explore something else.

Two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Octopuses are also known for their remarkable intelligence and problem-solving abilities. They can solve puzzles, navigate mazes, and even use tools.\n\nIf you're interested, I can share more animal facts, or we can explore another topic. What would you like to do next?"

Here's another amazing animal fact for you:\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nFact: The axolotl, a type of salamander, exhibits a unique trait called neoteny, which means it retains its juvenile features, such as gills, throughout its life. Axolotls are also capable of regenerating lost body parts, including limbs, parts of the spinal cord, and even portions of the brain. This remarkable ability makes them a subject of interest in regenerative medicine research.\n\nIf you'd like to hear more about animals or explore a different topic, just let me know!

You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8.
