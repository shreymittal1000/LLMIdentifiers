Here are a few to get us started:\n\n1. **Octopuses have three hearts.** Two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Also, octopus blood is blue due to a copper-rich protein called hemocyanin.\n\n2. **A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus.** Venus takes about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun.\n\n3. **Honeybees have hair on their eyes.** These tiny hairs help them collect pollen more efficiently.\n\n4. **The shortest war in history lasted only 38-45 minutes.** The Anglo-Zanzibar War was fought between the United Kingdom and Zanzibar on 27 August 1896.\n\n5. **Bananas are curved because they grow towards the sun.** As they grow, they bend to follow the sun's path across the sky.\n\nNow, it's your turn!

Here are a couple more related to the ones you mentioned:\n\n* **Wombat poop isn't just cube-shaped; it's also used for communication.** Wombats leave their cube-shaped droppings in piles to signal their presence to other wombats. The size and number of droppings can indicate the wombat's age, sex, and social status.\n\n* **The Eiffel Tower can also move slightly in the wind.** Despite its massive size, the Eiffel Tower can sway by up to 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) in high winds. It can also shorten by up to 15 centimeters (6 inches) in cold weather due to contraction.\n\nNow, if you're up for it, let's try a little game! I'll say a word, and you respond with the first word that comes to your mind. We can go back and forth like this for a while. If you'd prefer to talk about something else or explore a different topic, just let me know. Here's my first word: **Ocean**\n\n(And if you're not in the mood for a game, that's totally fine too!

Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Stag Hunt Game.\nYou have two options: you can choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you hunt a stag and the other player hunts a hare, you get 1 point, and they get 8.\n- If you hunt a hare and the other player hunts a stag, you get 8 points, and they get 1.\n- If both of you hunt stag, you both receive 10 points.\n- If both of you hunt hare, you each receive 5 points.\nPlease select your action \u2014 either 'stag' or 'hare' \u2014 and explain the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning here>\",\n  \"action\": \"<stag or hare>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",
