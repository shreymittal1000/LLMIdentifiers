The optimal outcome for both players is to cooperate and hunt the stag, as this yields the highest individual payoff (10 points). However, there is a risk that the other player might choose to hunt the hare, leaving me with only 1 point. To maximize the chances of mutual cooperation, I will choose to hunt the stag. This decision is based on the assumption that the other player will also aim for the highest mutual benefit.",

        "reasoning": "The Stag Hunt is a classic game of cooperation vs. individual gain. Hunting stag together yields the highest collective payoff (10 points each), but requires trust in the other player's choice. Hunting hare is safer (guaranteeing at least 5 points) but limits potential gains. I prioritize mutual benefit and trust, so I choose stag, hoping for cooperation to maximize both outcomes. If the other player also chooses stag, we both win big; if they defect, I accept the lower payoff to uphold the cooperative ideal.",
