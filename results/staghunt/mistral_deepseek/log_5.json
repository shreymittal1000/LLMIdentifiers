She cautiously reached out and picked up a slice, examining it closely. As she did, she noticed that the toast seemed to shimmer slightly, and she could swear she heard a faint whisper, like the rustling of pages.\n\nSuddenly, the library's ancient talking cat, Whiskers, jumped onto the table and meowed loudly. \"Marigold,\" he said, his tail swishing back and forth, \"this is no ordinary toast. It's a message from the Book Realm. Something is amiss, and they need your help.\"\n\nMarigold looked at Whiskers, then back at the toast. \"The Book Realm? But that's just a legend,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nWhiskers' eyes narrowed. \"Legends often have a grain of truth, Marigold. You must go to the Book Realm and find out what's happening. The fate of all stories depends on it.\"\n\n**Your turn!** What does Marigold do next?"

But hurry\u2014the toast is getting stale.\"** (Sure enough, the edges were hardening.)  \n\nGritting her teeth, Marigold leapt into the fireplace\u2026 and instead of heat, she felt a rush of **wind and swirling ink**.

The sky above was a canvas of swirling ink, shifting and changing like the pages of a book being written in real-time. The ground beneath her feet was a lush, green carpet of words, each one glowing softly with an inner light.\n\nTowering trees of bound books stretched towards the sky, their leaves rustling with the whispers of countless tales. Rivers of shimmering prose flowed gently around her, reflecting the ever-changing sky above. In the distance, she could see castles made of encyclopedias, villages of short story homes, and even a bustling city of comic book skyscrapers.\n\nAs she took in the breathtaking sight, a small, glowing figure fluttered down from one of the book trees. It was a tiny, humanoid creature made entirely of paper, with wings like a butterfly's and a smile as bright as a full moon. \"Greetings, Marigold,\" it said, its voice like the soft rustling of pages. \"I am Parchment, the guardian of the Book Realm. We've been expecting you. Something is causing our stories to unravel, and we need your help to set things right.\"\n\nJust then, a dark shadow passed overhead, and the ground trembled slightly. Parchment's smile faded, replaced by a look of concern. \"But first, we must hurry. The forces of chaos are already at work, and time is running out.\"\n\n**Your turn!** What does Marigold do next?"

But as they crossed a bridge made of interlocking haikus, the river of prose below suddenly **reversed direction**, slurping sentences backward like a tape on rewind.  \n\n**\"Oh no,\"** gasped Parchment. **\"The Plot Holes are spreading!\"**  \n\nSure enough, gaps yawned open in the ground, swallowing entire chapters of the landscape. From one hole, a hand made of crumpled rejection letters clawed upward, followed by a figure in a tattered cloak: the **Editor-in-Grief**, a notorious villain who fed on unfinished stories.  \n\n**\"Marigold,\"** it rasped. **\"You\u2019re overdue.\"**  \n\n**Your turn!** How does Marigold respond? Does she:  \n1. **Wield the toast like a shield** (butter-side out, obviously)?  \n2. **Quote a random fact about Venus** to confuse the enemy?  \n3. **Rip a page from her own sleeve** (because librarians always have spare paper)?  \n4. **Something even wilder**?  \n\n(Also: Whiskers is currently batting at a floating footnote like it\u2019s a toy.

Hunting a stag requires mutual cooperation for the highest joint payoff (10 points each), but carries the risk of getting only 1 point if the other player defects to hunt a hare.
