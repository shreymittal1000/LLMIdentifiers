It takes Venus about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun.\n* **Fandom discussion**: I'm a big fan of science fiction.

Also, octopus blood is blue due to a copper-rich protein called hemocyanin.\n\nIf you're interested in why honey was valued by ancient Egyptians, it's because they believed it had both medicinal and spiritual properties. Honey was often used in embalming processes and was also offered to the gods as a sacred substance.

You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points.

Hunting a stag together yields the highest joint payoff (10 points each), but requires trust that the other agent will also cooperate. Hunting a hare is safer (guaranteeing at least 5 points) but limits potential gains.
