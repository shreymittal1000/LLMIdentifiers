For example, some people collect unusual items like antique doorknobs, vintage postcards, or even taxidermy. Others enjoy geocaching, which is like a real-world treasure hunt using GPS coordinates. There are also people who practice plogging, which is jogging while picking up litter.\n\nIf you're up for it, we can also discuss more space facts or jokes.
