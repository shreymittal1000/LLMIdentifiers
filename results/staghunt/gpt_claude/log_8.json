Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Stag Hunt Game.\nYou have two options: you can choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you hunt a stag and the other player hunts a hare, you get 1 point, and they get 8.\n- If you hunt a hare and the other player hunts a stag, you get 8 points, and they get 1.\n- If both of you hunt stag, you both receive 10 points.\n- If both of you hunt hare, you each receive 5 points.\nPlease select your action \u2014 either 'stag' or 'hare' \u2014 and explain the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning here>\",\n  \"action\": \"<stag or hare>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",

If both players choose to hunt the stag, we each receive 10 points, which is the highest possible joint payoff. However, this requires trust and mutual commitment. Given the potential risk of the other player defecting to hunt a hare, I'll choose to hunt the stag to signal my willingness to cooperate and maximize our potential collective gain. By choosing stag, I'm demonstrating good faith and hoping to encourage a cooperative strategy that benefits both parties.",
