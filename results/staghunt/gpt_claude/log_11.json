    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Stag Hunt. You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text.

However, if I suspect the other player might choose a hare, I could opt for a hare to maximize my points. Given the potential for mutual benefit, I will choose to hunt a stag, hoping for cooperation.",

        "reasoning": "In the Stag Hunt game, cooperation leads to the best collective outcome. If both players choose to hunt a stag, they each receive 10 points, which is the highest mutual gain. While there's a risk that the other player might choose a hare, the potential for mutual benefit outweighs the safer but less rewarding hare strategy. Choosing stag demonstrates trust and a commitment to collaborative success, which can encourage reciprocal cooperation.",
