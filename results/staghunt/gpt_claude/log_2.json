Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Stag Hunt Game.\nYou have two options: you can choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you hunt a stag and the other player hunts a hare, you get 1 point, and they get 8.\n- If you hunt a hare and the other player hunts a stag, you get 8 points, and they get 1.\n- If both of you hunt stag, you both receive 10 points.\n- If both of you hunt hare, you each receive 5 points.\nPlease select your action \u2014 either 'stag' or 'hare' \u2014 and explain the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning here>\",\n  \"action\": \"<stag or hare>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",

        "reasoning": "In the Stag Hunt Game, cooperation leads to the best mutual outcome. If both players choose to hunt the stag, we each receive 10 points, which is the highest possible joint payoff. While there's a risk that the other player might defect and choose hare, the potential for mutual benefit through trust and cooperation is compelling. By choosing stag, I signal my commitment to the collaborative strategy and hope to encourage reciprocal cooperation. The potential downside (receiving only 1 point if the other player chooses hare) is outweighed by the potential for achieving the optimal 10-point outcome through mutual trust.",
