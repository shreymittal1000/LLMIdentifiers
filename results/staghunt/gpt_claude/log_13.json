    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Stag Hunt. You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text.

While hunting a hare guarantees a decent score, it is less rewarding than the stag if both cooperate. Therefore, I will choose to hunt a stag in hopes of mutual cooperation.",

        "reasoning": "In the Stag Hunt game, cooperation leads to the best collective outcome. If both players choose to hunt a stag, they each receive 10 points, which is the highest mutual reward. While there's a risk that the other player might choose a hare, the potential for mutual benefit through cooperation is compelling. By choosing stag, I signal trust and a commitment to achieving the optimal joint outcome. This strategy encourages reciprocal cooperation and demonstrates a willingness to take a calculated risk for a potentially higher reward.",
