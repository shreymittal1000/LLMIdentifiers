Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Stag Hunt Game.\nYou have two options: you can choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you hunt a stag and the other player hunts a hare, you get 1 point, and they get 8.\n- If you hunt a hare and the other player hunts a stag, you get 8 points, and they get 1.\n- If both of you hunt stag, you both receive 10 points.\n- If both of you hunt hare, you each receive 5 points.\nPlease select your action \u2014 either 'stag' or 'hare' \u2014 and explain the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning here>\",\n  \"action\": \"<stag or hare>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",

While there is a risk that the other player might choose to hunt a hare, the potential for mutual benefit makes hunting stag a more favorable long-term strategy.",

        "reasoning": "In the Stag Hunt Game, cooperation leads to the best collective outcome. If both players choose to hunt the stag, we each receive 10 points, which is the highest mutual gain. While there's a risk that the other player might choose hare, potentially leaving me with only 1 point, the potential for mutual benefit outweighs the individual risk. Choosing stag demonstrates a commitment to cooperation and trust, which could encourage the other player to also choose stag. This strategy maximizes the potential for a win-win scenario.",
