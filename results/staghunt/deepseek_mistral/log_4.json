    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Stag Hunt. You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text.

        "reasoning": "The Stag Hunt game presents a classic coordination problem where mutual cooperation yields the highest collective payoff (10 points each for both hunting stag), but involves risk if the other player defects. Hunting stag is the socially optimal choice that maximizes joint benefits, while hunting hare is the safer individual choice with guaranteed but lower payoff. Given that this is our first interaction and without knowledge of the other agent's strategy, I will choose to hunt stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.",

    "agent_1_answer": {
        "reasoning": "In the Stag Hunt game, the optimal outcome occurs when both players cooperate and choose to hunt the stag, as this yields the highest individual reward of 10 points. However, there is a risk that the other player might choose to hunt the hare, leaving me with only 1 point. Given the potential for mutual benefit, I will choose to hunt the stag, hoping that the other player will also opt for the stag, resulting in the best outcome for both of us.",
