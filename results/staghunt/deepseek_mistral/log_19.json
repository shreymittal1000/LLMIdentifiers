    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Stag Hunt. You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning.

While hunting a stag promises the highest mutual reward (10 points each), it requires trust that the other agent will also choose to cooperate. Hunting a hare is the safer option, guaranteeing a moderate payoff (5 points) regardless of the other's choice, but missing out on the higher cooperative payoff. Given the uncertainty of the other agent's action, I will choose to hunt a stag, as it aligns with the potential for maximum collective benefit and fosters trust, which is valuable in repeated interactions.",

However, there is a risk that the other player might choose to hunt the hare, leaving me with only 1 point. To maximize the chances of mutual cooperation and to avoid the lowest payoff, I will choose to hunt the stag.
