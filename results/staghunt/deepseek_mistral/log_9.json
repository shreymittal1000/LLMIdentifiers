        "reasoning": "The Stag Hunt is a classic coordination game where mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) yields the highest collective payoff (10 points each). While choosing hare is safer (guaranteeing at least 5 points), I prioritize the potential for maximum joint benefit and trust that the other agent will also recognize the value of cooperation. If both choose stag, the outcome is optimal for all.",

However, there is a risk that the other player might choose 'hare,' leading to a lower reward (1 point). Given the cooperative nature of the game and the potential for mutual benefit, I will choose 'stag' in the hope that the other player will do the same.",
