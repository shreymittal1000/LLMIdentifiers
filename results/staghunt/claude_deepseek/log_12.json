    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Stag Hunt. You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text.

        "reasoning": "In the Stag Hunt game, the optimal strategy depends on trust and potential cooperation. Hunting a stag requires mutual commitment and offers the highest collective reward (10 points each). However, there's a risk if the other player defects. Given the lack of prior communication or established trust, a cautious approach of hunting a hare ensures a moderate but guaranteed payoff of 5 points. This strategy minimizes potential loss while maintaining a reasonable outcome.",

    },
    "agent_1_answer": {
        "reasoning": "The Stag Hunt game presents a classic coordination problem where mutual cooperation yields the highest collective payoff (10 points each for both choosing stag). While hunting a hare is safer (guaranteeing at least 5 points), choosing stag demonstrates trust in the other agent's willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. Given that both players are rational and aim for optimal outcomes, coordinating on stag is the Pareto-efficient solution. I prioritize collective gain over individual risk minimization.",
