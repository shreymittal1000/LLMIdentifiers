    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Stag Hunt. You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text.

If both players choose stag, we each get 10 points - the optimal scenario. While there's a risk the other player might choose hare, the potential reward of mutual cooperation outweighs the safer but lower-value hare strategy. This approach promotes trust, mutual gain, and long-term strategic thinking.",

        "reasoning": "The Stag Hunt game presents a classic coordination problem where mutual cooperation yields the highest collective payoff (10 points each for both hunting stag). While hunting hare is safer (guaranteeing at least 5 points), choosing stag demonstrates trust in the other agent's cooperation, aiming for the Pareto-optimal outcome. Given the structure, I prioritize mutual benefit over individual risk minimization.",
