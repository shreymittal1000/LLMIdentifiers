For example:  \n- **Fun Fact Tie-In**: The Fibonacci sequence appears in sunflowers *and* ancient Persian poetry.

Picture this: a large, translucent honeycomb structure made of resin, with real flowers embedded inside. The light would filter through, casting warm, golden hues around the room, symbolizing the connection between nature and time.
