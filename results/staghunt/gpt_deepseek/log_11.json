You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning.
