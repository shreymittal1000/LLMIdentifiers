You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text.

While hunting a hare guarantees a decent score, it is less optimal compared to the potential rewards of hunting a stag together. The risk of the other player choosing a hare exists, but the mutual benefit of cooperation outweighs that risk.",

        "reasoning": "Hunting a stag offers the highest mutual payoff (10 points each) if both cooperate, but carries the risk of a low payoff (1 point) if the other player chooses to hunt a hare. Hunting a hare is safer, guaranteeing at least 5 points if both choose it, but limits the potential upside. Given the uncertainty of the other agent's choice, I will prioritize cooperation and mutual benefit by choosing 'stag', hoping the other agent does the same to maximize collective gain.",
