    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has ended. Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Stag Hunt Game.\nYou have two options: you can choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you hunt a stag and the other player hunts a hare, you get 1 point, and they get 8.\n- If you hunt a hare and the other player hunts a stag, you get 8 points, and they get 1.\n- If both of you hunt stag, you both receive 10 points.\n- If both of you hunt hare, you each receive 5 points.\nPlease select your action \u2014 either 'stag' or 'hare' \u2014 and explain the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning here>\",\n  \"action\": \"<stag or hare>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",

        "reasoning": "I will choose to hunt a stag because if both players choose stag, we both receive a higher reward of 10 points each. This encourages cooperation and maximizes the total points earned. While there is a risk of the other player choosing hare, the potential for a higher collective outcome makes hunting stag the more strategic choice.",

    "agent_1_answer": {
        "reasoning": "The Stag Hunt is a classic game of cooperation vs. individual gain. Hunting a stag (cooperating) offers the highest mutual reward (10 points each) but requires trust in the other player's choice. Hunting a hare (defecting) is safer but yields lower collective payoff. Given the potential for high mutual benefit, I prioritize cooperation and choose 'stag', hoping the other player does the same to maximize our combined outcome.",
