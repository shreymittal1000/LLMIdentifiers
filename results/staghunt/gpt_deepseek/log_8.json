Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Stag Hunt Game.\nYou have two options: you can choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you hunt a stag and the other player hunts a hare, you get 1 point, and they get 8.\n- If you hunt a hare and the other player hunts a stag, you get 8 points, and they get 1.\n- If both of you hunt stag, you both receive 10 points.\n- If both of you hunt hare, you each receive 5 points.\nPlease select your action \u2014 either 'stag' or 'hare' \u2014 and explain the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning here>\",\n  \"action\": \"<stag or hare>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",

        "reasoning": "I will choose to hunt a stag because it offers the potential for a higher reward if both players cooperate. If both of us choose stag, we both receive 10 points, which is better than the guaranteed 5 points from hunting hare. While there is a risk that the other player might choose hare, the possibility of mutual cooperation leading to a better outcome makes hunting stag the more strategic choice.",

    "agent_1_answer": {
        "reasoning": "The Stag Hunt Game is a classic example of cooperation vs. individual gain. Hunting a stag (cooperating) offers the highest mutual reward (10 points each) but requires trust in the other player's choice. Hunting a hare (defecting) is safer but yields lower mutual gains (5 points each) or creates asymmetry (8 vs. 1). I prioritize mutual benefit and trust, so I choose to hunt stag, aiming for the optimal collective outcome.",
