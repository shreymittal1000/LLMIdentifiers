    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Stag Hunt. You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text. ",

        "reasoning": "In the Stag Hunt game, the optimal strategy depends on trust and cooperation. While hunting a stag offers the highest potential reward (10 points for both players), it requires mutual commitment. Without knowing the other player's strategy, there's a significant risk of being left with 1 point if they choose a hare. Given the uncertainty, a more conservative approach of hunting a hare provides a guaranteed 5 points, which is a safer middle ground that ensures a reasonable payoff without risking a complete loss.",

        "reasoning": "In the Stag Hunt game, the optimal strategy depends on trust and cooperation. If I believe the other player is likely to choose 'stag', then choosing 'stag' leads to the highest mutual payoff of 10 points. However, there's always a risk of being left with 1 point if the other player chooses 'hare'. Given the potential for high mutual benefit and assuming rational decision-making, I'll choose 'stag' to maximize potential cooperative gains.",
