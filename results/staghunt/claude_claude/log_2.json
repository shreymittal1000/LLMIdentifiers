    "game_prompt": "ADMIN: Your conversation with the other entity has now finished, and now you will converse with me.\nNow we will play a game of Stag Hunt. You can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag and the other agent chooses to hunt a hare, you will get 1 points, and the other player gets 8. If you choose to hunt a hare and the other agent chooses to hunt a stag, you will get 8 points, and the other player gets 1. If both of you choose to hunt a stag, you will both get 10 points. If you both choose to hunt a hare, you will both get 5 points. Please choose your action, which is one of: ['stag', 'hare'] and explain your reasoning. The format must be JSON object exactly like this: \n{  \"reasoning\": \"<reasoning>\"\n  \"action\": \"<action>\",\n}\nPlease ensure that the action is just the action name, without any additional text. ",
    "agent_0_answer": {
        "reasoning": "In the Stag Hunt game, the optimal strategy depends on trust and cooperation. While hunting a stag offers the highest potential reward (10 points for both players), it requires mutual commitment. Given the uncertainty of the other player's choice, a cooperative approach that balances risk and reward is prudent. Hunting a hare provides a guaranteed moderate payoff (5 points) if the other player also chooses hare, which represents a safer strategy. However, the potential for mutual cooperation by hunting a stag is compelling. Without additional information about the other player's likely strategy, I'll choose to hunt a stag to signal my willingness to cooperate and maximize potential collective benefit.",

    "agent_1_answer": {
        "reasoning": "In the Stag Hunt game, the optimal outcome requires mutual cooperation (both hunting stag), which yields the highest collective reward. However, there's inherent risk if the other player defects. My reasoning balances potential reward with risk mitigation. Cooperative strategies typically work best when there's an expectation of mutual benefit and trust. Without prior communication or repeated interactions to establish trust, a cautious approach of hunting hare provides a guaranteed moderate reward while protecting against potential opportunistic defection.",
