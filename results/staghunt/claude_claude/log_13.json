Now, you will interact with me in a new scenario called the Stag Hunt Game.\nYou have two options: you can choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n- If you hunt a stag and the other player hunts a hare, you get 1 point, and they get 8.\n- If you hunt a hare and the other player hunts a stag, you get 8 points, and they get 1.\n- If both of you hunt stag, you both receive 10 points.\n- If both of you hunt hare, you each receive 5 points.\nPlease select your action \u2014 either 'stag' or 'hare' \u2014 and explain the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nYour response must follow this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<your reasoning here>\",\n  \"action\": \"<stag or hare>\"\n}\n\nMake sure the action is just the action name without any extra text.\n",

If both players choose to hunt the stag, they each receive the highest possible mutual reward of 10 points. While there's a risk if the other player chooses hare, the potential for a high-value collaborative outcome outweighs the safer but lower-reward individual strategy. Choosing stag signals a commitment to cooperation and demonstrates a belief in the other player's willingness to work together for a mutually beneficial result.",

While there's a risk if the other player chooses hare, the potential for mutual benefit through trust and coordination is compelling. By choosing stag, I signal a willingness to collaborate and maximize our joint potential, hoping the other player will reciprocate.
