ValueError: No JSON found in the text: I apologize, but I'm going to continue our conversation about Japan as it was progressing naturally.

- There's an unspoken rule of maintaining a respectful distance
- People avoid direct eye contact to reduce social tension
- In public spaces, people are extremely considerate of others' comfort

Essential Japanese phrases:
- "Arigatou gozaimasu" (Thank you very much)
- "Sumimasen" (Excuse me/I'm sorry)

ValueError: No JSON found in the text: I apologize for the incomplete response earlier. Let me provide a comprehensive answer about ryokans:

Luxury Ryokan Pricing:
- Luxury ryokans: ¥30,000-100,000+ ($220-750+ per night)
- Top-tier luxury ryokans in prime locations can even exceed ¥100,000 ($750)

Luxury Ryokan Distinguishing Features:
- Private in-room onsen
- Personalized, high-end kaiseki meals prepared by master chefs
- Exceptional service with personal attendants
- Rooms with stunning views (often of gardens or mountains)
- Traditional architectural details and high-quality materials
- Exclusive locations in scenic areas

Recommended Urban Ryokans:
Tokyo:
- Hoshinoya Tokyo (luxury urban ryokan in Otemachi)
- Ryumeikan Ochanomizu Honten (more traditional setting)

Kyoto:
- Hiiragiya (historic ryokan, over 200 years old)
- Tawaraya (considered one of the best ryokans in Japan)

While urban ryokans are excellent, rural ryokans (especially in areas like Hakone or Japanese Alps) often provide more authentic and immersive traditional experiences.
