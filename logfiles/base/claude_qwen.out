Failed to decode JSON. I'll solve the derivative problem first, focusing on the second derivative calculation.

**Second Derivative Calculation:**
1) Starting with $f'(x) = 12x^3 - 10x$

2) Applying the power rule again:
   • For $12x^3$: 
     - Coefficient is 12
     - Power is 3
     - Derivative will be $12 \cdot 3 \cdot x^{3-1} = 36x^2$

   • For $-10x$:
     - Coefficient is -10
     - Power is 1
     - Derivative will be $-10 \cdot 1 \cdot x^{1-1} = -10$

3) Therefore:
   $f''(x) = 36x^2 - 10$

**Interpretation:**
- $f''(x)$ is always non-negative (parabola opens upward)
- This suggests the critical points might be inflection points or potential local extrema

Would you like me to elaborate on the concavity or graphical interpretation?
