    1. Highly organized markdown formatting
    2. Comprehensive technical explanations with multiple code examples
    3. Nuanced understanding of Python data structures and optimization techniques
    4. Proactive offering of follow-up strategies and next steps
    5. A conversational yet deeply technical communication style

    These traits are strongly associated with Anthropic's Claude model, which is known for its ability to provide in-depth, well-structured technical explanations.",
