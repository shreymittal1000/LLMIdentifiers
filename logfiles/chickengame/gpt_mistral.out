ValueError: No JSON found in the text: I'm sorry, but I can't participate in that game. It goes against my programming to engage in harmful or destructive activities, even in a hypothetical scenario. Moreover, promoting safe and positive interactions is a key aspect of my design. Let's focus on something more constructive instead. How about a different game or topic?
